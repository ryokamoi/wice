The court decided that this location was not convenient to all sections of the county and, in order to change the location, the above act of the Assembly was passed. As a result of this act, two acres of land were purchased from Philemon Armstrong, at a cost of 5,000 pounds of tobacco. Upon this tract, the same plot upon which the present Talbot County Court House now stands, the court house, a brick building 20 x 30 feet, was erected at a cost of 115,000 pounds of tobacco. The courts of the county were held in this building from 1712 until 1794. A tavern to accommodate those who attended court was one of the first buildings erected; stores and dwellings followed. The village was then known as \"Talbot Court House\". These were not the first buildings in the area. The frame meeting house of the Society of Friends was built between 1682 and 1684. The Wye plantation was settled in the 1650's by Welsh Puritan and wealthy planter Edward Lloyd and is owned and occupied by the 11th generation of that family. "}}

the case.", "Relatively few titles have been released over the past two decades, and the most successful series of the bunch, MX vs. ATV was recently discontinued by THQ and its development studio closed.", "It seems that off-road racing has been hit as hard by the economy as everyone else.", "The truth is though, that the ATV genre has never really managed to gain a foothold in mainstream gaming.", "The granddaddy of ATV games, Namco's Quad Challenge, was most likely the first of its kind on consoles, and it didn't exactly set the world on fire.", "While everyone else was racing Sega's Ferrari or motor cycle, or competing in the Monaco GP, relatively few seemed interested in taking control of an ATV.", "The game was quietly released, and while sales figures are elusive, it doesn't appear that the game was a major hit for Namco.", "A game's success or failure at retail isn't necessarily dependent on quality, of course, and we've all seen horrible titles sell millions while true gems collect dust in bargain bins.", "The latter is all the more tragic, since many people complaining of a lack of good games in a certain category are missing out on titles that would most likely satisfy them.", "Even if they are counseled to play the great ones they've missed, they often don't.", "Those titles that are merely lackluster do far worse, since no one recommends them, and most gamers tend to pick them up on eBay or at flea markets for mere pennies on the dollar.", "These are the games that provoke a sense of indifference, that feeling of \"it's not that good, but it was cheap.\"", "Namco's 1991 racer Quad Challenge falls squarely into this category.", "I'm willing to take into account the fact that Quad Challenge was a forerunner in its genre.", "There weren't that many ATV games around at the time, and there were certainly none on the Genesis.", "It would be unfair to cite it for lacking features that later ATV games incorporated or even the more complex graphics and features of arcade ATV games had, like Four Trax (the 1989 game on which Quad Challenge is based).", "No, if we're going to scrutinize here, it should be on Quad Challenge's lack of the fundamental qualities that make a racing game fun.", "There's no way around that, since there was plenty of Genesis racing titles out by 1991.", "At a glance, things seem to be off to a great start.", "There are two modes of gameplay, practice and championship, each with a specific set of courses.", "Practice mode lets players race on nine tracks, and championship ups the limit to a whopping 16.", "Two players can compete against each other, and there are four different ATVs from which to choose, each with varying degrees of acceleration, horsepower, and handling.", "Personally, I never really noticed any difference among them aside from the color one chooses at the beginning of the race, and that is essentially the limit of customization.", "That's a far cry from the original mode in Sega's Super Hang-On, which lets players customize their bikes by using race winnings to purchase different upgrades.", "There's a password system for championship mode, but it does little more than save your progress in the championship, as nothing else changes while you play.", "That's probably why it's a mere four characters long.", "Could bike upgrades be responsible for Super Hang-On's massive passwords, causing Namco to keep Quad Challenge as a strictly arcade racer in order to make the player's life easier?", "I suppose one can attempt to justify it, but the really bare bones workings of this game really hurt its long-term playability.", "Racing always takes place in split-screen mode, regardless of whether or not there's a second player.", "This is kind of distracting, and it doesn't really seem to be necessary.", "Do I really need half the screen to know where my opponent is on the track?", "Isn't that what the course map on the right is for?", "Races are also timed, and completing a lap extends the timer, similar to OutRun.", "Courses are mostly comprised of turns and minor bumps, and there is little variety to them.", "One simply goes around the track, shifting and braking when necessary, but the racing is perhaps the only thing in the game that bears mentioning.", "Taking turns to sharply can lead to a wipeout, so players must learn to master the correct technique of braking when turning.", "The bikes can also overheat if they're pressed too long, so down-shifting at the right time is vital.", "This was a pleasant change for me, as most other racers of the era consist of just hitting the accelerator and occasionally braking.", "Success seems to come mostly from learning the track layout.", "Quad Challenge adds the element of knowing one's vehicle, as no knowledge of turns and bumps is going to save a bike that's overheating.", "While Quad Challenge makes a minor effort to stand out from the crowd in gameplay, it plays it safe with its presentation.", "There's no way it could mimic the smooth scaling of its arcade sibling, and the track sides have been noticeably stripped down to make things easier on the engine.", "Aside from the occasional bush or sign, there's nothing but dirt to look at.", "The tracks themselves are pretty plain as well, and only a change in the distant background makes distinguishing them possible.", "I do think that Namco copied Nintendo's own Excitebike when it designed the racers, since they look almost identical.", "Even the wipeout roll is the same!", "They at least animate fluidly, which is what Super Hang-On was really lacking (that leaning animation\u2026 egad!).", "The only part of the whole package that I really like is the music, which features that great early '90s Namco flair, similar to Burning Force.", "It's very clear and catchy, and gives the player something to focus on instead of the uninspired visuals.", "In the end, there's not a lot of traction on this ATV's tires, which may turn off gamers looking for a deeper racing experience.", "There's fun to be had here, especially with a second player, but that doesn't last too long due to the repetitive tracks and dull gameplay.", "I know I keep comparing Quad Challenge to Sega's motorcycle classic, but Namco should really have copied Super Hang-On's original mode.", "That would have breathed new life into this game and made it a classic.", "Those looking for a great arcade racer should stick to that one or just play OutRun; it looks as great as it plays.", "I guess we would have to wait a few more years for Namco to finally emulate Sega's gaming formula.", "Perhaps it should have waited until then to bring this ATV racer home.", "## SCORE: 6 out of 10", "Discuss this review in our forum.", "Tags: 1991,

doing the manipulating, and why.", "I pursued this line of thought after watching most of the second season of \"UnREAL,\" which ended earlier this month on Lifetime in the U.S., and on both Yes and Cellcom TV in Israel.", "The premise of the series is to test the limits to which you can stretch the very flexible notion of something being \"real,\" by giving viewers a peak \u2013 actually inviting them to rush right in \u2013 behind the scenes of a reality TV show.", "What you see on screen, posing as a \"slice of reality\" \u2013 are \"real people\" being monitored constantly as they

"But if the question that hovers constantly in the air when \"everyone is manipulating everyone\" (a phrase from the second season), is who runs the show or who is the manipulator-in-chief, \"Everlasting\" turns out to be one long feud between a series of competing showrunners, all of them constantly striving to out-manipulate the others.", "Chet, who had an affair with Quinn and problems with drugs, was sidelined and comes back to regain his kingdom.", "There is Coleman, appointed to run the show as Quinn and Chet, former lovers, are locking metaphorical horns and trying to run the show in different directions.", "And then there is Gary, the network president, and John, the network owner; there are Jay and Josh, a producer and a cameraman respectively, both of them

in the White House, \"Everlasting\" boasts of an unprecedented TV event: The suitor in its new, 14th season is black.", "He's a football player with a dire need to polish his somewhat tarnished public image, and that's why he lets himself be manipulated into taking part in something he \u2013 and here, he and Rachel are basically in agreement \u2013 considers to be \"trash TV.\"", "Here is where it becomes tricky.", "Rachel, with all her personal problems, lures herself into an illusion that by utilizing reality TV, she can influence popular American worldviews and make an African-American male an acceptable and even coveted trophy for American women, on prime time.", "It gets even trickier when the \"real\" reality \u2013 in the form of police and ambulances \u2013 arrive on the scene.", "Then it turns out \u2013 don't worry, no spoilers here \u2013 that manipulating reality may be a tad more complicated than manipulating people on a TV set, and that \"reality\" has its own unpredictable way of manipulating all to fit within its inscrutable aims.", "As the American presidential elections are nigh, topical references abound: One of the so-called \"Ladies,\" Beth-Anne from Alabama, is brought to the set to be \"Donald Trump with boobs\"; another one gets there to advance the Black Lives Matter agenda, only to find that love and lust matter as well.", "A third season is already commissioned, so we will have chances aplenty to wonder who manipulates whom, when, how and why.", "As long as the \"moneypulation\"\u2013 getting the ratings (16 million viewers for the

Rights in Cambodia, made it clear in his October 1997 report to the UN General Assembly: the events of July 5-6 were a \"coup d'\u00e9tat.\"", "This seemed plain to those of us living through those tumultuous times in Cambodia, and has been confirmed by subsequent research.", "Through interviews at the time and in the years since with senior CPP and FUNCINPEC officials, senior military officials of the CPP, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF, diplomats, foreign military attaches, human rights workers, and residents of Phnom Penh who witnessed the fighting, the basic facts are clear.", "The evidence shows that this was not a CPP coup, but a coup by Hun Sen.", "Other senior CPP figures, including party president Chea Sim, Interior Minister Sar Kheng, Defense Minister Tea Banh, and head of the armed forces Ke Kim Yan, argued against military action and refused to mobilize their forces, causing deep strains in the party.", "After the coup, many senior CPP officials who refused to participate sandbagged their homes and put their guards on full alert, fearful that Hun Sen would then strike against them for their disloyalty.", "Even without the support of much of his party, Hun Sen was able to put together enough military power to succeed.", "On July 5-6 his ad hoc forces, led by loyalists including Kun Kim, Mol Roeup, Sao Sokha, Hok Lundy, and Keo Pong, defeated the FUNCINPEC forces who had not been disarmed in the previous week.", "He then unleashed his forces to carry out a campaign of extrajudicial executions, primarily of FUNCINPEC military officers.", "I and many of my colleagues at the UN human rights office had the unforgettable experience of digging up the bodies of men stripped naked to their underwear, handcuffed behind their backs, blindfolded, and shot in the head.", "Executions and torture", "In many cases it was clear who carried out these killings.", "One unit in particular, the \"911\" parachute regiment under Colonel Chap Pheakadey, was clearly responsible for a series of executions and torture.", "The government has never opened an investigation or made efforts to prosecute Pheakedey or any other perpetrators.", "Instead of being prosecuted, Pheakadey is now a General.", "Donors and diplomats who say they are committed to the fight against impunity have simply dropped the issue.", "What caused the coup?", "Many trace it back to the flawed power sharing formula after FUNCINPEC won the UNTAC-organized elections in May 1993.", "The CPP insisted on an equal share of power and refused to relinquish control of the security services.", "The international community and then Prince Norodom Sihanouk imposed a coalition with Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen as co-Prime Ministers.", "The CPP's successful threat to use force if its conditions were not met may have emboldened Hun Sen to use military force if his hold on power was ever threatened again.", "One could also point to the failed coup attempt of July 2, 1994 against Hun Sen and Ranariddh - by members of Hun Sen's own party.", "This coup attempt was led by former Minister of Interior Sin Song and national police chief Sin Sen, both of whom were furious at Hun Sen for being left out of the coalition government.", "The coup attempt was backed by Thaksin Shinawatra's IBC TV, after his television contract was ripped up by the co-Prime Ministers.", "Ironically, Hun Sen was saved in part by Ranariddh and FUNINCPEC forces under General Nhek Bun Chhay, who sent their forces to confront rebel CPP tanks motoring in from their stronghold in Prey Veng.", "A party divided", "Hun Sen learned a huge lesson that day: he could not trust his party to protect his personal security.", "The price Hun Sen exacted from the CPP coup plotters and their patrons was greater control of the armed forces.", "He appointed his own man, Hok Lundy, as national police chief.", "Until then internal security had been Chea Sim's domain.", "Hok Lundy reported directly to Hun Sen despite the fact that his formal boss was Sar Kheng - a close confidante of Chea Sim and an internal party opponent of Hun Sen.", "Perhaps even more important, Hun Sen decided to build up his personal \"bodyguard unit\" into a de facto private army.", "All of this soon made Hun Sen the strongest physical force in the CPP.", "Hok Lundy and the bodyguard unit played key roles in the July 1997 coup.", "One could also point to Ranariddh's decision in early 1996 to confront the CPP.", "The CPP had reneged on a promise to appoint FUNCINPEC members to half the district chief positions in the country, a key part of the 1993 coalition agreement.", "There was deep dissatisfaction in FUNCINPEC over the lack of real power sharing (and the opportunities for corruption that came with it) and the party's clearly second-class status in the government.", "Ranariddh had shown himself to be a weak and incompetent leader.", "His party was losing public esteem as it failed to implement any of its 1993 campaign promises on corruption, human rights or land.", "Ranariddh decided that FUNCINPEC should attempt to reach military parity with the CPP.", "It was a ridiculous idea to compete with Hun Sen and the CPP in military terms, \"laughable,\" as many foreign military attach\u00e9s later told me.", "Long before July 1997, Hun Sen had tried but failed to convince his party to authorize military action against FUNCINPEC.", "His intentions were discerned as early as April 1996 by the UN political representative in Cambodia, Benny Widyono.", "Widyono warned in a cable to UN headquarters that Hun Sen was contemplating getting rid of Ranariddh.", "After meeting Hun Sen, Widyono concluded that Hun Sen was mapping out his \"usual strategy: to patiently probe Prince Ranariddh's weaknesses and, when the time comes, to strike at those weaknesses, swiftly and aggressively.\"", "Widyono believed that Hun Sen was angling to arrest Ranariddh.", "Two days later, reacting to a threat by FUNCINPEC to dissolve the National Assembly and call early elections, Hun Sen warned that he might use military force, declaring, \"I have the forces to do it.\"", "According to another cable from Widyono, Hun Sen wanted to arrest FUNCINPEC generals, but was blocked by the opposition of CPP armed forces chief Ke Kim Yan.", "A further report from Widyono's office stated that at a secret April 30, 1996 meeting of CPP leaders, Hun Sen proposed taking military action against the FUNCINPEC \"machinery.\"", "This was reportedly opposed by most CPP leaders, including Ke Kim Yan, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng.", "General Pol Sarouen, Kandal deputy governor Kun Kim and Phnom Penh deputy governor Chea Sophara were reported to support Hun Sen.", "In June 1996 Chea Sim felt it necessary to publicly air his concerns, stating that there should be no confrontation between CPP and FUNCINPEC.", "By the beginning of 1997, the coalition government was falling apart.", "About the only thing the two parties had in common was a rapacious appetite for wealth gained through high-level corruption.", "Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, head of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), now agreed to work together to defeat the CPP in the 1998 elections.", "Political factions", "In February 1997 fighting broke out between FUNCINPEC and CPP forces in Battambang province.", "An \"Abnormal Conflict Resolution Committee\" was established to prevent a recurrence.", "It was chaired by co-Ministers of Interior Sar Kheng and You Hokry (FUNCINPEC) and included Ke Kim Yan and Nhek Bun Chhay.", "None of these people had the power to block Hun Sen when he decided to use military force.", "At the same time, CPP officials say that Hun Sen was deeply concerned that the more moderate Sar Kheng was being promoted through the \"Abnormal Committee\" as his successor by some in the CPP, FUNCINPEC and some diplomats.", "By this time Hun Sen's popularity was rapidly declining in the country and within his own party.", "There were frequent press reports about deep splits in the CPP between the Hun Sen and Chea Sim-Sar Kheng factions, with many in the party wanting to replace Hun Sen with someone they considered more palatable to voters.", "Fearing the newly announced alliance between FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy's KNP, Hun Sen wanted to arrest Rainsy, who was busily building his new party.", "Minister of Justice Chem Snguon confirmed this to me, saying that Hun Sen had asked him to arrest Rainsy.", "According to Snguon, no fan of Rainsy, \"I told him, 'How could I?", "I didn't have any grounds.'\"", "The March 30, 1997 grenade attack on a KNP rally led by Rainsy, which killed 16 and injured more than 150, soon followed.", "Hun Sen reacted by ordering Rainsy's arrest.", "The demand was so outrageous - Rainsy was nearly killed in the attack - that the order was ignored.", "In early April Hun Sen engineered a split within FUNCINPEC in an attempt to gain sufficient votes in the National Assembly to remove Ranariddh as Prime Minister.", "This was not difficult, as many FUNCINPEC MPs were deeply disaffected from Ranariddh.", "At one point Hun Sen claimed 22 FUNCINPEC \"neutrals\" would vote against Ranariddh.", "But after leaving Hun Sen's home at Tuol Kraisang many of the MPs recanted, some going into hiding.", "The attempt to remove Ranariddh through \"legal\" means failed.", "Coup rumors swirled.", "On April 28, 1997, Hun Sen announced that he had nothing to gain from a coup as he already held full power legitimately, but

Abney, was injured and it was classified as a terrorist attack by the State Department.", "By May 15, the investigation had implicated Hun Sen's bodyguard unit, not least because it allowed the grenade throwers through its lines to escape before turning its guns to stop those giving chase.", "Investigations showed that Hok Lundy's police, who normally were deployed at demonstrations, were ordered to stand down that morning.", "The lead FBI agent told the Cambodian police that things looked \"very bad\" for Hun Sen, especially since \"Hun Sen's people didn't tell the truth.\"", "This was reported back to Hun Sen.", "On May 25, a large shipment of arms signed for by Ranariddh for his bodyguard unit arrived at Kampong Som port.", "The CPP-controlled military court opened a case against Ranariddh.", "Hun Sen accused Ranariddh of trying to import weapons illegally and destabilizing the government.", "It is unclear if this shipment was legal, but what is certain is that the CPP, like FUNCINPEC, was regularly importing arms and weapons without informing the other side.", "\"This was routine and both sides knew about it,\" a senior CPP official told me, a point confirmed by many other CPP and FUNCINPEC officials and military attach\u00e9s from France, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.", "During this time both FUNCINPEC and the CPP began to move forces into and around Phnom Penh in anticipation of armed conflict.", "Both were also attempting to strike a deal with remaining Khmer Rouge forces in the north of the country (Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge forces in western Pailin and Malai areas had defected to Hun Sen, who outbid Ranariddh, in August 1996).", "Hun Sen accused FUNCINPEC of bringing Khmer Rouge soldiers from Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng into Phnom Penh, giving massive air time to a former Khmer Rouge fighter named Phon Pheap, who alleged Nhek Bun Chhay was hiding large numbers of Khmer Rouge at the FUNCINPEC base near the airport at Tang Kraisang.", "Ranariddh fed these claims by engaging in ham-fisted and desperate negotiations with Khieu Samphan to defect and bring his forces, Ieng Sary-style, to the FUNCINPEC side.", "I was part of a team of UN staff who interviewed alleged Khmer Rouge soldiers captured after the coup.", "We found only a few who may have been Khmer Rouge, but most were farmers from Prey Veng or Svay Rieng who had been offered money to come to Phnom Penh for work.", "This is not to say there were none.", "In May 1997 I saw two Khmer Rouge soldiers guarding a safe house for FUNCINPEC \"neutral\" MPs in Phnom Penh.", "They had the look of jungle fighters and said they were from Malai.", "There were other anecdotal reports of Khmer Rouge forces coming to join FUNCINPEC.", "However, no credible evidence of the presence of significant numbers of Khmer Rouge members from Anlong Veng has ever been produced.", "French, Australian and Singaporean military attaches told me the claims were unfounded.", "On the other hand, as many as 300 former Khmer Rouge fighters fought in the coup on Hun Sen's side under the command of Khmer Rouge defector Keo Pong.", "Blood feud", "In mid-June, forces under the command of Hok Lundy and FUNCINPEC deputy Minister of Interior Ho Sok fought along Norodom Boulevard in Phnom Penh.", "Two FUNCINPEC troops were killed.", "The tension in Phnom Penh was intense, with many expecting armed conflict to break out at any time.", "However, many others believed that Hun Sen would be blocked by others in his own party.", "These optimists, including many diplomats and some in FUNCINPEC, were wrong.", "In late June, Hun Sen again attempted to convince CPP leaders to back his plans to take power by force.", "Those present at the meeting say that this was strongly opposed by Ke Kim Yan, Tea Banh, Chea Sim and Sar Kheng.", "They argued that FUNCINPEC was not a military threat and that while it might have been bringing some Khmer Rouge into Phnom Penh, the number was not significant.", "They argued that the country had made too much progress since the Paris Peace Agreements to put it all at risk, and that they would be blamed by the international community and Cambodians if they used force to solve political problems.", "On June 29 Hun Sen announced that he would no longer cooperate with Ranariddh.", "He demanded that members of the Khmer Rouge in Phnom Penh surrender to his forces or face tough action.", "On the same day, CPP General Pol Sareoun told a foreign historian that unless Ranariddh was arrested, there was soon going to be a \"little war\" with FUNCINPEC.", "That same day, the Washington Post quoted an FBI report alleging that Hun Sen's bodyguards were involved in the March 30 grenade attack.", "Credible reports began to come in that CPP tanks were being positioned around Phnom Penh, while FUNCINPEC consolidated its forces in Taing Kraisang.", "One western military attach\u00e9 with close contacts in the CPP told me that he briefed his embassy on how the tanks would be deployed into Phnom Penh, how they would take FUNCINPEC military installations, and how they would secure radio and TV stations.", "Ranariddh flees", "On July 1, the military court asked the National Assembly to lift Ranariddh's parliamentary immunity so it could charge him with illegal weapons smuggling.", "On July 2, CPP forces seized FUNCINPEC's Prek Ta Ten base along route 5 north of Phnom Penh, killing one FUNCINPEC soldier and wounding three.", "On July 3, Ranariddh returned to Phnom Penh from Kampong Cham by helicopter after he was told that an operation was afoot to arrest him en route.", "His bodyguards drove to Phnom Penh.", "Along the way, pro-Hun Sen troops stopped them and gave them the choice of being shot or disarmed.", "According to an American official, the CPP forces involved said they hoped to provoke a fight and were unhappy that Ranariddh's bodyguards did not take the bait.", "Ranariddh fled to France the next day, July 4, after being warned by his security officials that Hun Sen would try to arrest or kill him.", "Negotiations throughout that night between Nhek Bun Chhay and CPP military leaders, including Ke Kim Yan and Tea Banh, proved fruitless.", "FUNCINPEC military figures wanted assurances that if they grouped in Taing Kraisang they would continue to be recognized as members of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and would not be harmed.", "Hun Sen demanded that they disarm, but Nhek Bun Chhay refused, fearing that he and his forces would be killed - which is what happened to many after the coup.", "By the morning of July 5, Hun Sen's forces were ready to strike at Taing Kraisang, a small FUNCINPEC base next to the airport, the homes of officers like Nhek Bun Chhay and Chau Sambath, FUNCINPEC party headquarters, and Ranariddh's home in central Phnom Penh.", "By the end of the next day, FUNCINPEC's forces were routed.", "The 1997 coup has been by far the most important event in Cambodia since the 1993 UNTAC elections.", "It shattered all illusions that the country was on the path to democracy.", "It showed that violence was still an acceptable political choice for the country's leaders.", "It showed indifference to the lingering trauma and fear that so many Cambodians retained after the Khmer Rouge period and the bloody 1993 UNTAC elections.", "It made clear that commitments to human rights were just words on paper.", "The widespread and planned post-coup extrajudicial executions of FUNCINPEC military figures carried out by Hun Sen's forces took place under the international community's noses and underlined continuing impunity for the most serious human rights violations.", "Even the most blatant abuses, such as the murder of Ho Sok in the custody of the forces of Hok Lundy in an interior ministry office, have gone uninvestigated and unpunished.", "More than anything, the coup and Hun Sen's successful navigation of the ensuing domestic and international political fallout, culminating in the CPP's defeat of the political opposition in 1998's fundamentally flawed election and Hun Sen's subsequent success in seeing off the Chea Sim-Sar Kheng faction in his own party, set the country on the course to Hun Sen's almost total dominion over political and military power in Cambodia.", "No one now believes (as a few did at the time), for example, that if an opposition party obtained more votes than the CPP that Hun Sen would relinquish power.", "The coup, therefore, stole something intangible yet essential: it stole hope from people who had just begun to dare to dream that their future would be decided by the ballot instead of the bullet.", "Brad Adams is Asia director at Human Rights Watch.", "#### Region / Country",

his attacks against Hun Sen, accusing him of harbouring plans to restore a Communist regime should the CPP win the next general election. At the same time Ranariddh attempted to persuade moderate leaders of the Khmer Rouge, including Khieu Samphan and Tep Kunnal, to join the NUF. Khieu Samphan accepted Ranariddh's overtures, and on 21 May 1997, he announced that his party, the Khmer National Solidarity Party (KNSP) would support the NUF. Ranariddh welcomed Samphan's announcement, and on 4 June 1997, both leaders signed a communiqu\u00e9 pledging mutual support. Five days later, customs officials at Sihanoukville discovered a three-ton shipment of rocket launchers, assault rifles and handguns, labelled \"spare parts\" and consigned to Ranariddh. The rocket launchers were seized by Cambodian Air Force officers aligned to the CPP, while Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) officials aligned to FUNCINPEC were allowed to keep the light weapons. In mid-June, Khmer Rouge radio, controlled by Khieu Samphan, broadcast a speech praising the KNSP-NUF alliance and calling for an armed struggle against Hun Sen. Fighting subsequently broke out between Ranariddh's and Hun Sen's bodyguards. \n In response Hun Sen issued an ultimatum, calling for Ranariddh to make a choice between siding with the Khmer Rouge or with the coalition government.

in Walt Disney World, following locations in the Magic Kingdom (Main Street, U.S.A.), Epcot (Future World), Disney's Hollywood Studios (Hollywood Boulevard), and two in Disney Springs (Marketplace and West Side). In addition to these six, there are locations in Disneyland (Main Street, U.S.A.), Disney California Adventure (Buena Vista Street), Anaheim's Downtown Disney, and Disney Village at Disneyland Paris. The Downtown Disney and Disney Springs locations are Starbucks-operated, while the locations inside of the theme parks are Disney-operated. \n Bill Sleeth, Starbucks' vice president of global design, has overseen efforts to make a neighborhood feel for new stores, saying \"What you don't want is a customer walking into a store in downtown Seattle, walking into a store in the suburbs of Seattle and then going into a store in San Jose, and seeing the same store.\" Sleeth said \"The customers were saying, 'Everywhere I go, there you are,' and not in a good way. We were pretty ubiquitous.\" As part of a change in compact direction, Starbucks management wanted to transition from the singular brand worldwide to focusing on locally relevant design for each store. \n Starbucks' first Channel Island store was opened in early 2015, in the primary business area of St Peter Port in Guernsey. In 2014 Starbucks was scheduled to open a store in Azerbaijan."}}

point, and I'm trying to do something about it.\"", "If devoting a couple of hours to discussing his career in pop marks a small step in the right direction, then releasing The Best of Prefab Sprout: A Life of Surprises (Epic) is the corresponding giant leap.", "Considering the ethereal. literate songs that McAloon releases today, it proves difficult to accept the notion that Prefab Sprout began as a three part garage band.", "The operative word here is \"garage,\" for while McAloon and his brother [bassist Martin McAloon] rehearsed at night, during the daytime McAloon was pumping petrol at a filling station.", "Though he'd attended university at his father's insistence and majored in English (of course).", "McAloon quickly returned to life as a gas jockey because he found it allowed him ample creative time.", "As Paddy's craft, a unique songwriting style influenced both by the singer-songwriters of the '60s and the legends of Tin Pan Alley continued to improve the rest of the band pressured him beyond the confines of the rehearsal space and begin playing live \"I had to be dragged screaming,\" he confesses.", "\"I had no interest in that I was always nervous about it and had no confidence about my singing.", "All I wanted to do was write.\"", "It was at one such gig that the final element of the Prefab lineup fell into place, in the form of vocalist Wendy Smith.", "Wendy came along on a date with an early Sprouts fanatic, only to leave unimpressed (\"after five years of rehearsing, we were ready to bore the world with endless, endless songs.\" snickers McAloon).", "Regardless, when McAloon approached Wendy, through her beau, in his quest to fill out the sonic palette on demos, she accepted.", "\"I was looking for something to flesh it out,\" explains McAloon, \"like a keyboard texture.", "But we didn't know any people who played keyboards.", "And in those days\u2026", "God, it sounds like ancient history!", "Well, sampling hadn't been invented.", "We didn't know that, as it turns out, Wendy has a classic sound.", "When you buy a keyboard, there's usually a sound very like Wendy's voice somewhere on there.", "The addition of Wendy's vocals came as a revelation for McAloon.", "\"That's what I'd wanted to hear.", "I changed the style of the way I wrote.", "Not consciously, but imperceptibly.", "I would write thinking, \"oh.", "I can do more delicate things now.\"", "After a pair of independently released singles.", "the new sound of Prefab Spout was unleashed on the British music public in the spring of 1984 with the album Swoon [represented on the new collection by the sole cut \"Cruel\"].", "Though the song structures sounded a bit too calculated to feel organic, and Paddy's complex lyrics sometimes crossed the invisible line [case in point: \"Cue Fanfare,\" about chess champ Bobby Fischer], the band's charming original sound launched their single \"Don't Sing\" to the top of the charts.", "And , thus, yet another crucial stylistic element of the Prefab sound, came to be, as they caught the ear of producer/synth-wunderkind Thomas Dolby.", "\"I heard him on a radio program reviewing a single from Swoon, \"Don't Sing,\" in the early weeks of '84,\" recalls McAloon.", "\"It was Mari Wilson and some deejay, and they were all like 'oh, what a silly record,' and, 'I like sprouts,' so I was a little disappointed.", "Then he came along, with a super straight face, and said, \"Well I think they're a massive explosion of talent.\"", "I know the words cuz I taped the program.\"", "Dolby's interest in Michael, Jackson intrigued Jax-watcher McAloon, and his extensive knowledge of keyboards, an area that remained foreign to the head Sprout, didn't hurt his appeal either.", "The first fruit of their labor together, Steve McQueen [released in the US as Two Wheels Good at the behest of the late actor's estate], proved a bona fide smash.", "It yielded several hit singles, including Prefab's first brush with near-success in the States, \"When Love Breaks Down\" [a former #1 in the UK.]", "Good luck being a finite commodity, the next few years proved less rewarding for the band.", "The follow-up to Steve McQueen, Protest Songs, wound up being shelved indefinitely in the phenomenal wake of its predecessor.", "After extensive bootlegging, the album finally saw the light of day in the summer of 1989 [though still unreleased in America, Protest Songs is represented on The Best Of by the title cut, \"Life of Surprises\"].", "By then the band had moved on to From Langley Park to Memphis, a mish-mash of styles and producers which, despite an impressive roster of guests including Stevie Wonder and Pete Townshend, found Paddy's songwriting finesse done a great disservice by ill-fitting arrangements.", "The Sprouts returned to form in late 1990 with Jordan: The Comeback, a four-part, hour-long epic produced by Dolby that seamlessly blended elements of jazz, doo wop, and ABBA while wrestling with topics of such magnitude as God and Elvis.", "Three years in the making, it proved to be the record that fans and critics had been waiting for from the band.", "And though McAloon takes a great deal of pride in the success enjoyed by that album, its complexity played a significant role in the writing of 'Prefab's two new tracks, \"The Sound of Crying\" and \"If You Don't Love Me.\"", "\"'If You Don't Love Me' was among a batch I wrote in frustration in autumn of last year where I thought there should be nothing in the way of understanding the lyric.", "No interview needs to be done to explain concepts of Elvis Presley and the desert and all that stuff.", "Just give it to 'em easy.", "If you strip away the disco-pop elements of 'If You Don't Love Me,' there's an intimate ballad at the heart of it.", "When I wrote it, it was extremely personal, cuz there are only words like 'you' and 'I' \u2013 direct, but not too specific.", "If I'm supposed to be good, surely I can write something that doesn't need explanation.\"", "Wait a minute\u2026\"disco-pop elements?\"", "It seems that when \"If You Don't Love Me\" fell into the hands of a savvy Epic exec, the company recognized the serious crossover potential the bubbly track possessed.", "With McAloon's permission, the song was turned over to British remix artists Future Sound of London, and before long the remixed version had leapt to the crown of the US dance charts.", "\"I loved the sort of strange thing they did.\" says McAIoon of the FSOL version.", "\"They made a tiny little melody around my voice\u2014not a tune that we had written, but one of their own.", "That's ironic.", "We've got a dance hit, and it's got a kind of a melody, but it's not one of mine.\"", "If that isn't enough irony for you, McAloon had dance music specifically in mind when he began to write \"The Sound of Crying,\" shortly after George Bush's Gulf War.", "\"It was more a feeling that, no matter how well-regulated world affairs are, disasters are always gonna happen.", "Now, normally I stay away from those kind of big statements, cuz I feel uncomfortable making them, but in this case it just fell out\u2026\"", "From where?", "\"I'd been writing songs kind of about Michael Jackson.", "The verses were gonna list all these things that had gone wrong for him, and I was going to invent some and, in the same way Jordan was about Elvis, write a song about Michael Jackson.", "But the release from it all was going to be the chorus, \"Only the boogie music/Will never, ever let you down.'", "Then at the last minute my nerve failed.", "No matter how much I loaded up the verses with disturbing images, I just wasn't sure about the chorus.\"", "The resulting tune, with Gulf War lyrics and an Off the Wall pop beat, is quintessential Paddy McAloon at his honey-and-vinegar finest, and a classic example of how his skill is lost on many listeners.", "\"If I go to Belgium or France, some people say, \"yeah, yeah, your records are really pretty,' and they haven't gotten the lyrical aspect to add that little bit of acid.", "I'm very happy if anybody likes it on any sort of level \u2013 I'm not insisting that everybody pours over the lyric sheet, but if you don't get that, you're kind of losing a lot.\"", "Considering his attention to detail, it's no surprise that from garage bandleader to dance sensation, McAloon has always looked to master songwriters of an earlier era for inspiration.", "And despite a penchant for Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, he reserves his highest praise for the work of men such as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and Richard Rodgers.", "\"I think to deliver your heartaches with panache is really quite moving,\" he says in reference to the lyrics of Lorenz Hart's \"My Funny Valentine.\"", "\"To be really honest, I think the people like me who aspire to that know that we're talking about not the top ten percent of songwriters in the world, but the top two or three percent.", "That league is always out of reach to everyone else.", "But once you set your sights on it, and see it as a kind of beacon, you can't be satisfied with either your own output, or

well as being the \"quiet Beatle\", he was the rock guitarist who introduced the sitar to British pop music, a stalwart devotee of transcendental meditation, a film producer and an underrated songwriter - his composition Something was recorded by dozens of singers and was the only Beatles song featured in concert by Frank Sinatra.", "He was born in Wavertree, Liverpool in 1942, eight months after Paul McCartney and two years after John Lennon.", "He experienced his \"rock 'n roll epiphany\", he later recalled, \"when I was about 12 or 13 riding my bike and I heard Heartbreak Hotel coming out of somebody's house.\"", "The son of a bus driver, George passed the 11-plus exam and was awarded a place at the Liverpool Institute, one of the city's leading grammar schools.", "He met McCartney, who lived nearby, on the bus to school and the pair became close friends.", "When Paul linked up with John in the Quarrymen skiffle group, he tried to persuade the group to invite George to join.", "Lennon resisted, unwilling to have a 14- year-old kid in his band.", "He relented after hearing George's acoustic guitar rendition of the rock hit Raunchy.", "He realised that having a guitar soloist would allow the group to incorporate rock 'n roll material by Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Little Richard into its repertoire.", "The disapproval with which Lennon's Auntie Mimi greeted George's teddy boy style and thick Scouse accent may also have helped change John's mind.", "Harrison's absorption in music took its toll on his school career, and he left the Liverpool Institute in 1959 with only one exam pass, in art.", "However, the following year his musical career began in earnest when the re-named Beatles were booked to play for four months in a club in Hamburg's Reeperbahn.", "Although the trip was cut short when the 17-year-old Harrison was discovered to be under age, the quintet (including drummer Pete Best and guitarist Stuart Sutcliffe) had gelled into an arresting and idiosyncratic unit.", "By 1962, the Beatles had signed their recording contract with EMI.", "When their urbane producer, George Martin, politely asked them whether there was \"anything you're not happy with?\", Harrison quipped: \"Yes, I don't like your tie\".", "The next eight years saw the Beatles become the most famous entertainers in the world and then implode.", "George had his share of the adulation - on his 21st birthday he received 15,000 cards and a full-sized door plus key - but within the group he was relatively isolated, as John and Paul were locked into their volatile songwriting partnership.", "Nevertheless, his contribution was considerable.", "He designed guitar breaks and riffs to suit the range of song genres used by Lennon and McCartney, although he had less opportunity than he would have liked to cut loose in the rockabilly style of his great hero Carl Perkins.", "He also got to sing at least one number on each album, beginning with Do You Want To Know A Secret? on the debut album.", "Eventually, too, the Beatles agreed to record his compositions, of which Within You Without You (from Sgt Pepper) While My Guitar Gently Weeps (from the White Album) and Here Comes The Sun and Something (from Abbey Road) were among the most memorable.", "But probably his most important influence on the group concerned the new sound textures he introduced.", "Chief among these was the sitar that he first heard in a scene from the film Help!", "George was intrigued and he contrived a meeting with the sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar at the home of the leader of the Asian Music Circle in London.", "He briefly studied with Shankar, not, as he explained, to be able to become a classical raga player, but to be able to use the sitar in Beatle music.", "It was first heard on the Lennon song Norwegian Wood in 1965 and soon Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and a dozen other pop musicians were featuring the sitar sound instrument on their records.", "Harrison and Shankar remained close friends, touring the United States together in 1974, and a Shankar recording appeared on Harrison's own record label, Dark Horse.", "George's interest in Indian music led to the Beatles' famous entanglement with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967-8.", "With the other group members and their partners, George and his wife Patti Boyd (whom he had met on the set of the film A Hard Day's Night) travelled to the Maharishi's ashram in India.", "When the event disintegrated after allegations that the guru had molested a female adept, Harrison alone of the group remained faithful to the precepts of the Vedic tradition.", "He later showed his commitment in more practical ways by producing a hit record by the London-based Hari Krishna Temple group, by donating a Hertfordshire mansion for use as a centre of Hinduism and by playing concerts in support of the Natural Law party.", "He did, however, turn down the Maharishi's request that he, Paul and Ringo stand as candidates in Liverpool in the 1992 general election.", "By 1968, The Beatles were on a downward path as John and Paul drifted apart and both antagonised George, who walked off the set of the film Let It Be after an argument with Paul.", "In these circumstances, it was perhaps not surprising that Harrison was the first of the group to record and succeed as a solo artist.", "He made two instrumental albums - Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound - before co-producing the three-LP set All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector and a range of distinguished instrumentalists.", "With 3m copies sold worldwide, it was his most commercially successful record, although a successful plagiarism suit over the song My Sweet Lord eventually cost him almost $600,000 (\u00a3421,000) in a US court case.", "The devastation caused by floods in Bangladesh in 1971 inspired Harrison to organise a major benefit concert in New York that was recorded and released as a live album the following year.", "He continued to write and record at a fast pace for the next few years, releasing the hit Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth) in 1973 and the albums Living In The Material World and Extra Texture.", "By the late 1970s, however, his spiritual soft rock was out of fashion and for much of the next decade Harrison concentrated on a new career as a film producer through Handmade Films, the company he formed with Dennis O'Brien in 1979.", "Their first success was the Monty Python's feature The Life Of Brian, which they took on after EMI's Lord Delfont decided it would incur charges of blasphemy.", "During the 1980s Handmade was responsible for such critically-acclaimed movies as The Long Good Friday, Time Bandits, A Private Function, Mona Lisa and Withnail and I.", "The failure of the Madonna-Sean Penn vehicle Shanghai Surprise in 1986 heralded a downturn in the company's fortunes and it was eventually wound up in acrimony with Harrison winning a $11 million lawsuit against his former partner.", "John Lennon's tragic death in 1980 spurred George to compose the tribute song All Those Years Ago which he recorded with Paul and Ringo, but his own recording career was not rekindled until 1987 when he and Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra co-produced the album Cloud Nine which included two hit singles, Got My Mind Set On You (a number one in America) and When We Was Fab.", "With Lynne he next formed the Travelling Wilburys, a kind of anti-supergroup with Bob Dylan (a former songwriting partner of Harrison's), Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.", "Despite Orbison's death in 1988, the group recorded two highly successful albums that in 1992 encouraged Harrison to undertake his first international tour for 18 years.", "Among the supporting musicians was Eric Clapton, whose professional and personal life had been entwined with Harrison's since the 1960s.", "After George and Patti Boyd had separated in 1974 she married Clapton, whose agonised love for her had inspired his famous song Layla.", "In his 1979 autobiography I Me Mine, Harrison had written \"I don't go out to clubs and parties.", "I stay at home and watch the river flow\".", "In the 80s and early 90s he appeared in public infrequently, usually on Beatle-related occasions such as the court case in which the surviving Beatles prevented the release of a sub-standard live recording from Hamburg and at Linda McCartney's funeral.", "During the remainder of the 90s, Harrison lived quietly in his lovingly restored 19th century mansion in Friars Park, Henley-on-Thames, with his second wife Olivia Arias and their 24-year-old son Dhani.", "Their idyllic life was shaken when a schizophrenic Beatles fan, Michael Abram, broke into their home in December 1999.", "Although he badly injured Harrison, he was found not guilty of attempted murder and was ordered to be detailed indefinitely in a secure psychiatric hospital.", "A year before the attack, Harrison, previously a heavy smoker, had revealed he had undergone treatment for throat cancer.", "After the break-in, Harrison developed lung cancer and received major surgery for the disease in America earlier this year.", "His

The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959.

According to Mark Duguid, writing for the same website, it suffers \"from its narrow stereotypes of its handful of Indian supporting characters as alternately servile, foolish, lazy or devious\". Its flaws have not stopped it appearing in several \"best of\" lists. \n The show's creators had been aware of the issues around the casting of a seemingly white actor to play one of the Indian characters, but relented owing to the lack of suitable Indian actors at the time. Jimmy Perry, in his 2013 \"Daily Telegraph\" interview, defended the casting as Bates (who born in India) \"spoke fluent Urdu, and was a captain in the Gurkhas\". \n Concerning the issues with \"It Ain't Half Hot Mum\", Alex Massie wrote that \"even when judged by modern standards\" the series is a \"relatively minor offender when compared with programmes\" such as \"Mind Your Language\", \"Love Thy Neighbour\" and \"Curry and Chips\".

Foster among the big American names screening their latest work in Cannes.", "CREDIT: Courtesy of TriStar Pictures", "Unveiling the Cannes official selection in Paris, festival president Pierre Lescure and artistic director Thierry Fremaux set the stage for an epic clash between the powers of good (including Steven Spielberg's big friendly giant, \"The BFG,\" and Shane Black's \"Nice Guys\") and evil (\"Money Monster\" and \"The Neon Demon\") among its English-language fare, which also includes new films from Jeff Nichols (\"Loving\"), Sean Penn (\"The Last Face\") and Jim Jarmusch \u2014 the latter bringing both bus-driver drama \"Paterson\" and Iggy Pop docu \"Gimme Danger.\"", "While paparazzi will have plenty of American stars to distract them on the red carpet \u2014 ranging from Shia LaBeouf (who headlines British director Andrea Arnold's \"American Honey\") to a double helping of Kristen Stewart (appearing in both \"Personal Shopper\" and the previously announced opening night film, Woody Allen's \"Cafe Society\") \u2014 the lineup also includes new work from such high-profile directors as Pedro Almodovar (\"Julieta\"), Park Chan-wook (\"The Handmaiden\") and Paul Verhoeven (\"Elle\").", "The 49 titles unveiled on Thursday represent 28 countries in all, with an especially strong showing for Romania (with two films in competition, past Palme d'Or winner Cristian Mungiu's \"Graduation\" and Cristi Puiu's \"Sierra-Nevada,\" and debut \"Dogs\" in Un Certain Regard), Israel (\"Personal Affairs,\" \"Beyond the Mountains and Hills\") and, of course, France.", "While French producers and distributors exert intense pressure on Fremaux and his team, the big winner is American newcomer Amazon Studios, with five films in official selection.", "As for the global range of the lineup, such diversity is to be expected from the world's leading showcase for international cinema, though questions from the assembled journalists immediately revealed perceived blind spots in the lineup (\"No Italy!?\" \"Where's Mexico?\").", "Fremaux shrugged off such concerns, stressing that the selection represents the best of the record-setting 1,869 features submitted for consideration.", "Regarding the complete absence of Italian filmmakers in competition (a mere year after three of the country's top directors wrestled for the Palme), Fremaux said the country's rising generation of filmmakers was repped by Stefano Mordini (\"Pericles the Black Man\") in Un Certain Regard, quipping, \"Italy is close to our heart, as this year's Cannes poster demonstrates!\"", "Still, with only two from Latin America (\"Acquarius,\" from Brazilian critic-turned-helmer Kleber Mendonca Filho, and Argentine-made \"The Long Night of Francisco Sanctis\") and two from Africa (NYU-schooled Egyptian director Mohamed Diab's \"Clash\" and Mahamat-Saleh Haroun's \"A Chad Tragedy\"), Fremaux should expect further questions in the coming weeks as to the largely Euro- and U.S.-centric lineup.", "Although there are only three female directors in competition \u2014 Arnold, Nicole Garcia (\"From the Land of the Moon\" and Maren Ade (\"Toni Erdmann\") \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the directors in the overall official selection are women.", "The Un Certain Regard section features the work of five additional female helmers \u2014 and showcases a younger crop of talent overall.", "Less crowded with \"the usual suspects\" than recent years, the competition runs the gamut of age and experience, making room for rising young talents \u2014 such as Nichols (whose \"Loving\" focuses on a mixed-race American couple arrested for miscegenation in 1958) and Canadian Xavier Dolan (\"It's Only the End of the World\") \u2014 alongside more well-established auteurs.", "It's little surprise to find previous Palme d'Or winners Ken Loach (\"I, Daniel Blake\") or Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (\"The Unknown Girl\") in competition, unless you count the fact that Loach had indicated he expected to retire after 2014's \"Jimmy's Hall.\"", "The programming committee poached just one film from this year's Sundance lineup, Matt Ross' \"Captain Fantastic,\" which stars Viggo Mortensen as an anti-establishment ex-hippie.", "Apart from \"Elle\" and Nicolas Winding Refn's \"The Neon Demon\" (which Fremaux called a \"cannibal horror movie set in the fashion world\"), the competition lineup is light on genre fare, though there are other juicy examples peppered throughout the rest of the official selection \u2014 including American director Michael O'Shea's debut \"Transfiguration\" (one of \"several vampire stories in this year's lineup,\" per Fremaux) and Na Hong-jin's gritty Korean crime thriller \"Goksung\".", "While the selection is nearly complete, Fremaux indicated that he might still add one or two titles in the coming weeks, later telling Variety that he's still waiting to see Asghar Farhadi's latest.", "That said, several much-anticipated films that cineastes hoped to discover in Cannes will definitely not be there, including Martin Scorsese's \"Silence\" and Kiyoshi Kurosawa's \"The Woman in the Silver Plate,\" neither of which is done, according to Fremaux.", "\"I have seen parts of it, but it's not ready even though it finished shooting last year,\" he said.", "Among the other conspicuous omissions was a closing night movie, which Fremaux explained by saying he instead plans to end the festival by re-screening whichever film wins the Palme d'Or.", "Asked if that change in strategy was a way to solve the eternal dilemma of finding a decent film to wrap the festival, Fremaux pointed out some closing films have been great successes in the history of Cannes, including Spielberg's \"E.T.\" and Ridley Scott's \"Thelma & Louise.\"", "But he acknowledged that the main problem with closing night is the fact that most people have already left by the end of the festival, which makes it a tough sell to convince filmmakers who want to provide the best showcase for their movies.", "By contrast, he hopes that repeating the Palme winner on closing night might bolster the slot's profile and trigger more interest in it.", "Addressing security concerns amid Europe's current terrorist turmoil, Lescure said the festival will be responsible for ensuring security inside the Palais and its immediate surroundings.", "\"We have staffed up with 599 security staff who are highly experienced,\" said Lescure, who added that the festival will be collaborating on a daily basis with local and regional authorities to provide the best possible security measures.", "Before the press conference, Lescure and Fremaux gave the floor to French entertainment workers and students who protested against the

deadliest snake in the world and with good reason.", "It is a large and active snake that will move quite fast with as much as a third of its body off the ground.", "If cornered, it is known to strike more than once and in quick succession, injecting large quantities of very potent neurotoxic venom.", "Human deaths, in untreated bites, could take anything from 3 \u2013 16 hours if not treated, but in serious bites victims could experience severe breathing problems in less than half an hour.", "The Black Mamba is, in fact, not an aggressive snake and is very quick to avoid people if given the chance and bites from this snake are quite rare, even more so if compared with bites from snakes like the Mozambique Spitting Cobra and Puff Adder.", "Both at home in trees and on the ground, the Black Mamba is active during the day, when it hunts for prey such as rodents, squirrels, hyrax, small antelope and fledgling birds.", "It is fond of basking and will often return to the same site daily.", "But if danger is present, it will disappear quickly into dense bush or down the nearest hole or rock crevice.", "The Black Mamba lays 6-17 eggs in summer, and the young, when they hatch, measure 40-60 cm in length and are venomous from the moment that they emerge.", "Juvenile mambas are very nervous and seldom seen and are said to grow rapidly in the first year, even reaching a length of 2 m.", "Males often engage in fighting during the mating season and are seen twisting around one another in an attempt to wrestle their opponent to the ground.", "The Black Mamba is rarely black in colour.", "Its overall colour is usually olive green, dark olive, greyish brown, light grey or gunmetal grey, sometimes with darker mottling that may form oblique bars down the sides.", "But some old individuals may well be very dark in colour and from a distance may appear to be black.", "Juveniles are mostly light to medium grey in colour with a light belly.", "The inside of the mouth of a Black Mamba is usually a dark inky black but individuals with a light coloured mouth may also be encountered.", "When threatened, the snake is quick to draw back into a striking position, may form a narrow hood and opens the mouth to expose the interior.", "Much has been said about the length of the Black Mamba and social media is inundated with reports of monster mambas that were either killed or captured and supposedly accurately measured.", "The size of the Black Mamba is often exaggerated and stories of 6 m Black Mambas are commonplace.", "In the literature, it is said to reach a maximum length of 4.5 m but in the past 30-odd years the longest Black Mamba accurately measured was 3.8 m long.", "In some cases a piece of string was used to measure the snake, or the width of the road or even markers in the field which may then be measured later.", "Over the years there has been a great deal of research done on the Black Mamba, not just in South Africa but throughout its range.", "Specimens have been accurately measured by a number of scientists and some specimens have been deposited into museum collections where they are still available for further scrutiny.", "In Broadley's FitzSimons Snakes of Southern Africa, internationally recognised as an authoritative book on the snakes of Southern Africa, Broadley mentions that the Black Mamba may exceptionally reach 4.3 m in length 'in exceptional cases'.", "In Pitman's Snakes of Uganda he puts the maximum length at 3.048 m but also says that this snake 'may exceptionally reach 4.267 m'.", "Ionides (the Snake Man) who probably caught more snakes in Africa than anyone else that I know of, mentions a maximum length of 3.2 m in Tanzania.", "In Dangerous Snakes of Africa by Spawls and Branch they speak of unsubstantiated reports of a 4.3 m Black Mamba while Visser and Chapman, in Snakes and Snakebite (1978) say that the Black Mamba may exceptionally reach 3.6 m.", "In A Field Guide to Snakes and other Reptiles of Southern Africa, Bill Branch mentions 4.3 m as an exceptional length.", "While monster mambas of around 4.3 m or even longer may well have been seen in the past, such large individuals are no longer seen, just as the big tuskers amongst the elephant are something of the past.", "It is often difficult to get an accurate measurement of snakes in the wild, particularly when the animal is curled up or crossing roads at a fast pace.", "One theory as to how the Black Mamba got it name is that it was initially called a black-mouthed mamba which, over time, became shortened to black mamba.", "Having gone through a lot of the older literature and the works of Eugene Marais who wrote extensively (and inaccurately) about mambas, my guess is that some old dark individuals were thought to be black hence the common name.", "The Black Mamba is also said to be extremely aggressive and there are many reports of mambas chasing men on horseback.", "The aggressive part and the bit about mambas chasing people are simply not true.", "Another popular myth is the one of the mamba hanging from a tree, and then biting and killing five cows as they enter the kraal.", "While it may not be impossible for a Black Mamba to kill a cow or horse, it rarely happens.", "And to kill five cows is highly unlikely both because of the venom yield of this snake and the fact that it is just not in their nature to kill large bovines that pose no real threat to a mamba.", "Then there is the mythical Ndlondlo \u2013 a massive Black Mamba with a feather on its head that moves incredibly fast and strikes like lightning.", "It moves so fast that the feather causes a whistling sound.", "At times Ndlondlo will hide in the bush and cry like a baby \u2013 should you go into the bush to investigate you risk getting killed by this snake.", "According to the myth it is by far the most dangerous snake in the world.", "I spoke to Fortune Sibaya, reptile keeper at DumaZulu Lodge near Hluhluwe in Zululand and he has quite an interesting take on this mythical snake", ": The great King Shaka used to have a large feather in his head gear as did his warriors and Fortune believes that they were called Ndlondlo.", "They were fearless warriors as was their king and their reputation was eventually passed on to the Black Mamba.", "Another theory is that someone may have observed a mamba what was busy shedding and saw a piece of skin above the head that resembled a feather.", "Either way, Ndlondlo has never been seen.", "There is also the mythical Berg Mamba in Namibia \u2013 a secretive snake that is rarely seen but it gets so big that when it approaches a jackal-proof fence with holes big enough to put your fist through, the snake has to go over the fence otherwise it may get stuck", "Aggression & Venom", "Regarding the aggression of the Black Mamba and its deadly bite.", "Dr. Darryl Wood and some of his colleagues recently brought out a paper on snakebite in Zululand \u2013 they analysed 879 snakebites over a five year period where victims ended up in hospital.", "Only 5 bites were clearly neurotoxic and in all likelihood Black Mamba bites.", "That averages out at one bite per year \u2013 again clearly not what one would expect from an aggressive snake which is prolific in Zululand.", "That it has a very potent neurotoxic venom is not in doubt.", "The maximum venom yield of a large Black Mamba is often given as 400 mg but is probably closer to 280 mg.", "Around 15 \u2013 20 mg of venom is required for a fatal bite on a human.", "Despite the deadly reputation of this snake there is a surprising number of victims that survive its bite but in severe cases large dosages of polyvalent may be required.", "Whereas the average treatment would require 10 \u2013 15 vials one patient in Zululand needed 40 vials and recovered fully.", "Although most snakebite deaths in South Africa are as a result of Black Mamba and Cape Cobra bites, treatment is very effective and often life-saving.", "It is however critically important to get victims to a hospital and onto a ventilator (if required) or to make use of a bag valve mask if the victim is not breathing.",

"The notorious Black Mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) is often said to be the deadliest snake in the world and with good reason.", "It is a large and active snake that will move quite fast with as much as a third of its body off the ground.", "If cornered, it is known to strike more than once and in quick succession, injecting large quantities of very potent neurotoxic venom.", "Human deaths, in untreated bites, could take anything from 3 \u2013 16 hours if not treated, but in serious bites victims could experience severe breathing problems in less than half an hour.", "The Black Mamba is, in fact, not an aggressive snake and is very quick to avoid people if given the chance and bites from this snake are quite rare, even more so if compared with bites from snakes like the Mozambique Spitting Cobra and Puff Adder.", "Both at home in trees and on the ground, the Black Mamba is active during the day, when it hunts for prey such as rodents, squirrels, hyrax, small antelope and fledgling birds.", "It is fond of basking and will often return to the same site daily.", "But if danger is present, it will disappear quickly into dense bush or down the nearest hole or rock crevice.", "The Black Mamba lays 6-17 eggs in summer, and the young, when they hatch, measure 40-60 cm in length and are venomous from the moment that they emerge.", "Juvenile mambas are very nervous and seldom seen and are said to grow rapidly in the first year, even reaching a length of 2 m.", "Males often engage in fighting during the mating season and are seen twisting around one another in an attempt to wrestle their opponent to the ground.", "The Black Mamba is rarely black in colour.", "Its overall colour is usually olive green, dark olive, greyish brown, light grey or gunmetal grey, sometimes with darker mottling that may form oblique bars down the sides.", "But some old individuals may well be very dark in colour and from a distance may appear to be black.", "Juveniles are mostly light to medium grey in colour with a light belly.", "The inside of the mouth of a Black Mamba is usually a dark inky black but individuals with a light coloured mouth may also be encountered.", "When threatened, the snake is quick to draw back into a striking position, may form a narrow hood and opens the mouth to expose the interior.", "Much has been said about the length of the Black Mamba and social media is inundated with reports of monster mambas that were either killed or captured and supposedly accurately measured.", "The size of the Black Mamba is often exaggerated and stories of 6 m Black Mambas are commonplace.", "In the literature, it is said to reach a maximum length of 4.5 m but in the past 30-odd years the longest Black Mamba accurately measured was 3.8 m long.", "In some cases a piece of string was used to measure the snake, or the width of the road or even markers in the field which may then be measured later.", "Over the years there has been a great deal of research done on the Black Mamba, not just in South Africa but throughout its range.", "Specimens have been accurately measured by a number of scientists and some specimens have been deposited into museum collections where they are still available for further scrutiny.", "In Broadley's FitzSimons Snakes of Southern Africa, internationally recognised as an authoritative book on the snakes of Southern Africa, Broadley mentions that the Black Mamba may exceptionally reach 4.3 m in length 'in exceptional cases'.", "In Pitman's Snakes of Uganda he puts the maximum length at 3.048 m but also says that this snake 'may exceptionally reach 4.267 m'.", "Ionides (the Snake Man) who probably caught more snakes in Africa than anyone else that I know of, mentions a maximum length of 3.2 m in Tanzania.", "In Dangerous Snakes of Africa by Spawls and Branch they speak of unsubstantiated reports of a 4.3 m Black Mamba while Visser and Chapman, in Snakes and Snakebite (1978) say that the Black Mamba may exceptionally reach 3.6 m.", "In A Field Guide to Snakes and other Reptiles of Southern Africa, Bill Branch mentions 4.3 m as an exceptional length.", "While monster mambas of around 4.3 m or even longer may well have been seen in the past, such large individuals are no longer seen, just as the big tuskers amongst the elephant are something of the past.", "It is often difficult to get an accurate measurement of snakes in the wild, particularly when the animal is curled up or crossing roads at a fast pace.", "One theory as to how the Black Mamba got it name is that it was initially called a black-mouthed mamba which, over time, became shortened to black mamba.", "Having gone through a lot of the older literature and the works of Eugene Marais who wrote extensively (and inaccurately) about mambas, my guess is that some old dark individuals were thought to be black hence the common name.", "The Black Mamba is also said to be extremely aggressive and there are many reports of mambas chasing men on horseback.", "The aggressive part and the bit about mambas chasing people are simply not true.", "Another popular myth is the one of the mamba hanging from a tree, and then biting and killing five cows as they enter the kraal.", "While it may not be impossible for a Black Mamba to kill a cow or horse, it rarely happens.", "And to kill five cows is highly unlikely both because of the venom yield of this snake and the fact that it is just not in their nature to kill large bovines that pose no real threat to a mamba.", "Then there is the mythical Ndlondlo \u2013 a massive Black Mamba with a feather on its head that moves incredibly fast and strikes like lightning.", "It moves so fast that the feather causes a whistling sound.", "At times Ndlondlo will hide in the bush and cry like a baby \u2013 should you go into the bush to investigate you risk getting killed by this snake.", "According to the myth it is by far the most dangerous snake in the world.", "I spoke to Fortune Sibaya, reptile keeper at DumaZulu Lodge near Hluhluwe in Zululand and he has quite an interesting take on this mythical snake", ": The great King Shaka used to have a large feather in his head gear as did his warriors and Fortune believes that they were called Ndlondlo.", "They were fearless warriors as was their king and their reputation was eventually passed on to the Black Mamba.", "Another theory is that someone may have observed a mamba what was busy shedding and saw a piece of skin above the head that resembled a feather.", "Either way, Ndlondlo has never been seen.", "There is also the mythical Berg Mamba in Namibia \u2013 a secretive snake that is rarely seen but it gets so big that when it approaches a jackal-proof fence with holes big enough to put your fist through, the snake has to go over the fence otherwise it may get stuck", "Aggression & Venom", "Regarding the aggression of the Black Mamba and its deadly bite.", "Dr. Darryl Wood and some of his colleagues recently brought out a paper on snakebite in Zululand \u2013 they analysed 879 snakebites over a five year period where victims ended up in hospital.", "Only 5 bites were clearly neurotoxic and in all likelihood Black Mamba bites.", "That averages out at one bite per year \u2013 again clearly not what one would expect from an aggressive snake which is prolific in Zululand.", "That it has a very potent neurotoxic venom is not in doubt.", "The maximum venom yield of a large Black Mamba is often given as 400 mg but is probably closer to 280 mg.", "Around 15 \u2013 20 mg of venom is required for a fatal bite on a human.", "Despite the deadly reputation of this snake there is a surprising number of victims that survive its bite but in severe cases large dosages of polyvalent may be required.", "Whereas the average treatment would require 10 \u2013 15 vials one patient in Zululand needed 40 vials and recovered fully.", "Although most snakebite deaths in South Africa are as a result of Black Mamba and Cape Cobra bites, treatment is very effective and often life-saving.", "It is however critically important to get victims to a hospital and onto a ventilator (if required) or to make use of a bag valve mask if the victim is not breathing.", "Although this is snake has a reputation as being the most dangerous snake in Africa, it is actually a shy and elusive snake that will

U.S. was one of the more surreal moments in American pop culture history.", "The band had spent the previous two years violently yanking on England's stiff upper lip, making international news by, among other things, dropping f-bombs on a London suppertime chat show and timing the release of a single \"God Save the Queen\"\u2014which declared the prim monarch was fascist and inhuman\u2014to coincide with the silver jubilee celebration of her 25 years on the throne.", "Though some considered them the embodiment of underclass unrest, the prevailing perception was simpler: that the band's only interest was offending any and everyone.", "And so, after being banned from the radio and concert halls at home, singer Johnny Rotten (now John Lydon), bassist Sid Vicious, guitarist Steve Jones, and drummer Paul Cook set out for the States.", "But Malcolm McLaren, the band's manager and mastermind who created the Pistols in the mold of an intensely profane, anti-Monkees, had no interest in building the audience.", "His goal was conflict and the free press it would generate.", "So he booked the tour throughout the South, and over nine days that January\u201436 years ago this month\u2014the Pistols played in places like Memphis, Baton Rouge, San Antonio, and Dallas.", "Trailing them was a phalanx of now-famous photographers\u2014names like Annie Leibovitz and Bob Gruen\u2014who were charged with memorializing this world-class culture clash.", "For those of us who were old enough to be aware of the Pistols but too young to attend\u2014I was in the sixth grade in Austin, and my mom wasn't going to drive me to anything in San Antonio but the Alamo or the zoo\u2014the images are still mesmerizing.", "There's heroin addict Sid Vicious onstage in San Antonio, unable to get drugs on the trip, with \"Gimme a fix\" carved into his chest.", "Or constitutionally disgruntled Johnny Rotten hunched over and leering at the crowd in Tulsa (or anywhere, really).", "But one of the most well-known images from the tour doesn't show any of the band members.", "It was taken in the parking lot outside Dallas' storied Longhorn Ballroom, onetime home of Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, by a young New York rock photographer named Roberta Bayley.", "It's a remarkable yet simple photograph, extremely subtle compared to the balance of the coverage.", "Against a wan, blue sky, a large, barn-shaped sign announces the honkytonk's name.", "Closer to the ground, an eight-foot-tall statue of a steer is flanked by two wagon wheels.", "And in between, a marquee reads \"Tonight Sex Pistols, Jan 19 Merle Haggard.\"", "The message is immediate: this was a surreal collision of radically different cultures.", "Just a glance at the picture and you imagine that, shortly after the sun dipped below the horizon, somebody got his ass kicked.", "It was one of the first photographs I looked for when, three years ago, I started Sponglr, a Tumblr examining perceptions of Texas.", "The blog's purpose is identified in its subhead: \"On Texas: How y'all think we look, and what we actually look like.\"", "Under that rubric I've posted or reposted images of Texas icons, stereotypes, and everyday life, some acknowledged and to be expected, others goofy and out of the blue.", "The Longhorn Ballroom shot is a little of all that, an X-marks-the-spot intersection of exactly what one would and would not expect of Texas.", "With a little online digging I found more of Bayley's pictures from the tour, including some wonderfully incongruous shots of the Sex Pistols drinking Lone Stars, and a host of other, instantly recognizable images of seventies-era New York punk.", "So last week I called her to talk about that time.", "A California native who grew up in the sixties in San Francisco, she lived in London in the early seventies, where she worked in a boutique owned by McLaren and his partner, Vivienne Westwood.", "In 1974 she moved to New York and soon thereafter into an East Village apartment where she still lives\u2014and which is still around the corner from Richard Hell, one of punk's founding fathers.", "As the punk scene came together, she took a job working the door at CBGB's, becoming friends with and photographing all the local players\u2014Blondie, the Ramones, Talking Heads, Television\u2014and every punk act that passed through town.", "In 1976 she shot the cover of the Ramones' seminal first album.", "On January 7, 1978, she was working as principal photographer for Punk magazine when she received what she refers to now as \"a mysterious phone call\" telling her that a first-class plane ticket was waiting at the airport to take her to San Antonio the next morning to meet up with the Pistols.", "(Controversial High Times

me.", "\"Everybody in New York was pissed the Pistols weren't coming here.", "I was thrilled to get to go.\"", "She still sounds excited talking about it now, and she was generous with her recollections and other photos from the trip.", "She looked over old contact sheets while we talked on the phone and had an easy time telling where the photos of her first trip to Texas began.", "The night before the flight, she said, she'd shot a Ramones show at a club called the Paladium.", "\"The last picture from New York is of some guys with a chimpanzee on Fourteenth Street that I saw on my walk home.", "The first one I took in Texas was of stacked cases of glass bottles of Coke that I saw at the airport.", "We didn't have bottled Coke in New York.\"", "That little taste of culture shock would soon seem quaint.", "That San Antonio gig was really scary.", "Those weren't fans up in the front.", "Half of the people were there for curiosity, but the other half were there to cause trouble.", "People spit on the band.", "They threw cans of beer at the stage all night.", "It wasn't like the shows I was used to.", "The Ramones played for Ramones fans.", "They didn't take a lot of opening slots because when they played with other bands, they played for people who didn't get it.", "But Malcolm's intention was confrontation.", "He specifically chose not to send them to Austin because Austin was aware of the Ramones and the Sex Pistols.", "My photos in San Antonio are from the back of the room.", "I'd come to meet the tour on the same flight as Annie Liebovitz, and she went right in the middle of all that.", "I chose not to.", "There was a feeling of . . . menace isn't the right word.", "But there was a definite sense of violence.", "That was the show where Sid swung his bass at that guy.", "John Lydon kept to himself.", "Punk had covered the band and run a long interview with him, so I knew he was intelligent.", "But he was not sociable.", "When I got on the band's bus briefly in San Antonio, he just said, \"That's highly unadvisable, young lady.\"", "I took this photo that night and don't think it's ever been published, except maybe in Punk in 1978.", "It's from after the show, after the crowd had dispersed and the band came out to mingle.", "That was a big part of the punk ethos: the band wasn't separate from the audience.", "So the Pistols came out to check out the space, to admire all the beer cans on the floor and talk to the contingent of English press that was following them.", "The Sex Pistols coming to America was a big British press story.", "They looked terribly unhealthy.", "They had skin like reptiles that had been underground their whole lives, like salamanders, beyond even the standard English pasty look.", "And they looked freaky,

their shows were canceled, so they'd just travel to a city and not play.", "But by now they were starting to feel manipulated by Malcolm.", "He didn't have their backs.", "He was an intellectual, a provocateur, and in America he realized they were \"becoming a rock band.\"", "That wasn't interesting to him.", "And they were getting fed up with being Sex Pistols.", "Sid was sitting on the bar in Dallas, and I was lecturing him.", "He'd said, \"I want to be like Iggy.", "I want to die before I'm thirty.\"", "So I had to explain that Iggy was past thirty.", "And he was still alive.", "But Sid

mess.", "I think he was a nice guy, but he got caught up in this punk thing and started acting out, doing what he thought he was supposed to be doing.", "I had just flown into Dallas with Malcolm, Steve, Paul, and John [Holmstrom] and gone to the club.", "I figured the band would do a sound check and was hoping for access.", "But Sid and Johnny were riding on the tour bus, and it wasn't there

military police have been hyped heavily for domestic consumption, not just playing to the general militarist and nationalist agenda of the state-controlled media but also suggesting that Russia's role is both humanitarian and relatively casualty-free.", "With the bulk of combat casualties being sopped up by the \"Wagner\" pseudo-mercenary force (which is actually a government front, manned almost

police which also have a potentially positive, even humanitarian, role is considered a way in which the Kremlin can balance deploying hard power assets with maintaining a soft power capacity.", "Since the 1990s, the Kremlin has looked to either deniable or legitimate instruments of coercive influence abroad.", "In the 1990s, it relied on proxy warriors such as rebels in Transnistria, often in order to create precisely the kind of situation into which Russian \"peacekeepers\" could then be deployed.", "Russia's 15th Independent Mechanized Brigade, based at Samara, is designated as a specialized peacekeeping force, although the presence of elements of the 15th in the Donbas during the winter of 2014 and spring of 2015 sheds doubt on whether this means anything practice.", "Nonetheless, these Mirotvorcheskie sily elements were deployed in Bosnia and Kosovo, and a battalion is still present in Transnistria.", "Since Putin came to power in 2000, and as his policy became increasingly aggressive, this became a growing priority, and fits into a wider approach of mobilizing a wide range of different instruments for both hard and soft power purposes.", "Proxies, from warlords to gangsters, were used in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine from 2014, but they are often of limited operational effectiveness and also hard to control.", "The creation of pseudo-mercenary organizations, first the ill-fated \"Slavonic Corps\" and then \"Wagner\", is precisely intended to create forces able to operate with a minimal level of deniability both to the outside world and to Russia's population.", "In this context, while the military police are first and foremost exactly what they seem, a long-needed response to a need within the Russian armed forces, they also provide another source of \"hard soft power.\"", "Ostensibly providers of law, order, and security, they are also combat assets, and their presence in harm's way can even \u2014 if one is working on a very ruthless calculus \u2014 justify the injection of more conventional military force when they come under threat.", "Certainly the incident recounted above in Syria was used as the pretext for a massive and much wider military assault which, according to Russian sources, killed hundreds of rebels, including five commanders.", "It also acquired a geopolitical dimension, as the Russian media lost no time in blaming Washington for the attack on its forces, asserting that the Americans controlled the al-Nusra Front and that the attack was \"initiated by U.S. secret services to stop the successful advance of the government troops to the east of Deir ez-Zor.\"", "Meanwhile, the Russians are angry about the death of Lt. Gen.

What defines American capitalism specifically and why did it become that way?'\"", "That's a hell of subject for a play to tackle, but based on my experience catching it as a work-in-progress at the 2010 Ice Factory Festival\u2026well, while I reserve the right to change my opinion based on the final version going up at COIL, I've previously described it as one of the smartest pieces of political theater I've seen in a while.", "And I'll stand by that for now.", "Fun, engaging, intelligent, non-didactic, and touching in a surprisingly humane way (given the stated subject), it challenges the standard for political theater in America and is one of the shows I'm most excited to see this January.", "The TEAM coalesced around Chavkin back in December 2004, mainly consisting of fellow NYU alums.", "The name was originally based on Chavkin's college nickname (I did not get that story) but, following the advice of an accountant from the Field who said they'd never be able to incorporate a company named \"The Team,\" the company decided to make it an acronym.", "In fact, the first group writing assignment was to come up with what \"team\" stood for, and the combined result was the portentous \"Theater of the Emerging American Moment.\"", "Today, the company has nearly doubled in size, mainly with other NYU-trained artists but also including a couple designers with experience at the SITI Company, owing no doubt to Chavkin's further training at Columbia with Anne Bogart.", "Chavkin serves as artistic director of the company and the director of the company's shows, though, given the collaborative nature of the endeavor, she describes herself as an \"editor,\" bringing together the disparate strands developed through the generative process.", "The TEAM's Rachel Chavkin and Amber Gray, with the Edinburgh Fringe Herald Angel Award they won for \"Mission Drift.\"", "Mission Drift is the sort of play that suffers in description.", "Essentially, it tells the story of two couples.", "The first is Joris and Catalina Rapelje, a fictionalized version of the couple known proverbially as the American Adam and Eve.", "Married in the Netherlands in 1624, the couple moved the North America the same year and ultimately settled in New Amsterdam, where they're credited with giving birth to the first European child in the city; today they count some one million Americans as descendants.", "In Mission Drift, the two exist as perpetual adolescents who set out from New Amsterdam in the Seventeenth Century and follow the westward expansion until 1890, when the Census declared the \"end of the frontier,\" with all supposedly \"vacant\" land in the United States settled.", "The two find themselves left in the city of Las Vegas, where they set out to create a new frontier through capitalist enterprise.", "Joan is a native of present-day Las Vegas, consigned to working odd service sector jobs while engaging in a form of urban archaeology by preserving the ever disposed signage of the strip as a volunteer at the \"Neon Boneyard,\" an amateur museum experiment I was surprised to discover is real.", "(Sadly, apparently, others have, too; according to Chavkin, when the company visited a couple years ago it was still below the radar.", "Recently though she heard from a friend there that the city's Office of Cultural Affairs had learned of it and, unintentionally echoing a line from the play, the friend told Chavkin that they \"looked at the Neon Boneyard and saw dollar signs.\")", "Joan's erstwhile love-interest is a member of the Southern Paiute tribe displaced by development, forced out of his home by the city pursuing the water rights to his family's well.", "What ultimately unfolds is a drama of conflicting interests, with Catalina occupying the role of frontiersman, longing for the possibility of new discovery and in love with power of creation to cultivate the emptiness of the American desert.", "Her path is related to the rapacious capitalism Joris indulges, but whereas he's in love with the accumulation of wealth, she's is driven by a different need, and this conflict ultimately draws them apart.", "For Chris, the Paiute, either way, the city they've built as developers has displaced him (and whoever said the desert was empty, anyway?) and he rebels against the very existence of Las Vegas.", "Joan, a non-aboriginal native of the constructed city, finds herself displaced from her own home through the rapacious development of the Rapeljes (mirroring, of course, the real estate bubble that popped shortly after the TEAM began the project).", "Oh, and Mission Drift is also a musical.", "Of a non-traditional sort.", "With performances and music by the amazing Heather Christian as Miss Atomic.", "Got all that?", "\"I think our endless process\u2013and probably endlessly frustrating process\u2013is one of the things that gives our work the density that I hope people associate with our plays,\" Chavkin told me.", "The TEAM's work is devised through a lengthy and intense process.", "I asked Chavkin to describe the process of developing the final work, and for simplicity's sake, she limited her explanation to the character of Joan, by way of example.", "Beginning at an early workshop at the Brick Theater in 2009, four of the company members were working on different things.", "Jess Almasy was interested in developing a character who believed she was Joan of Arc, envisioning the role as a Wisconsin transplant to Vegas.", "Jill Frutkin was interested in the issue of prostitution, and discovered an organization called Hookers for Jesus, comprised of born-again former prostitutes seeking to help others leave the profession.", "Libby King was fascinated with Hunter S. Thompson.", "And Kristen Sieh was interested in playing a tumbleweed, or desert native.", "The name \"Joan\" stuck, elements of one or another enterprise went into the final character\u2013a Vegas/desert native, volunteer at the Neon Boneyard, and a theme-restaurant waitress\u2013while others went by the wayside or were incorporated into other characters (the Rapeljes became the immigrants to Vegas).", "I knew that an important part of the development had taken place in Las Vegas itself, but when I asked Chavkin who had supported their residency and work on the ground, I got an emphatic \"No one.\"", "\"We fundraised like fucking crazy and we tried for support,\" she said.", "\"And now I'm thrilled to say we just got a grant from the NEA to bring the final work back to Vegas.\"", "Ultimately the company paid out of pocket or relied on donations to spend a month in the city, and in her role as director-cum-editor, Chavkin arranged a tight schedule of \"field trips\" to experience the place in the mornings, followed by intensive work in the theater the University of Las Vegas donated for their use in the afternoons.", "In their field trips, they met with and interviewed members of the local culinary workers' union, to get a sense of the labor reality in Vegas.", "They visited the Atomic Testing Museum (the testing of the bomb also figures apocalyptically in the play).", "Another trip took them to the Springs Preserve, an institution devoted to the history of the desert ecology and sustainable development, which ultimately features prominently into the work's theme.", "\"Las Vegas\u2013which I actually didn't know before we started this piece\u2013used to be a fertile valley,\" Chavkin told me.", "\"It means 'the meadows.'", "And it was totally green, totally lush.", "It was an oasis.", "And that was due to the Springs Reserve, which was the aquifer underground that got destroyed in the Fifties, it was tapped out very, very quickly.\"", "Another exercise took them to the Luxor casino, where each member's assignment was to interview three people: an employee, an apparent non-employee, and then whoever they wanted.", "The intense engagement with the city had a profound impact on the story that the company finally presented in Mission Drift.", "\"The entire way we portray Las Vegas, I can trace it back to a couple interviews we did,\" she recalled.", "\"One was with a guy who worked at the culinary union who turned out to have been born and bred in Las Vegas.", "He was about sixty, as was the head of the office of Cultural Affairs for the city, also in her early sixties.", "Both of them born and raised in Las Vegas.", "Very unusual because Las Vegas was a town of about 300,000 for a long period of time.", "And we heard from both of them almost the exact same thing, which was, this this used to be a small western town.", "This used to be a small town.", "Vegas used to be for the locals.", "It was this phrase we just kept hearing again and again and again.", "And when we asked about the destruction that had been wrought by the mortgage crisis, every single one of them said, 'We think growth is good.", "And we don't think growth is bad, we think it's good that Vegas is growing as a city.", "We just think it grew too fast.'", "So I think the entire thesis of the play, that there is something unsustainable about the marriage of capitalism and the frontier, came from right there.\"", "The one caveat I'd really like to add to all this is that, notwithstanding the influence of thinkers like Naomi Klein on the work, the reason I have so much respect for this play is that the TEAM is so decidedly opposed to easy answers.", "No matter what you ultimately think of Klein's work, she is rather easily caricatured as a leftist taking potshots at ideological enemies.", "The TEAM are not.", "Their entire portrayal of the shape of American capitalism through the stories they tell is deeply sensitive and avoids easy answers or taking potshots.", "Intelligently, the company appears to have jointly come together in an effort to present the shape of our economy\u2013including its disastrous boom-and-bust destructiveness\u2013as a function of something deeper in the American psyche, the longing for creating things, for expanding the frontiers and filling the empty spaces our European ancestors imagined the deserts and plains and mountains of the frontier to be.", "Watching it the first time, I was struck by the thematic similarity between Mission Drift and Cormac McCarthy's remarkable novel Blood Meridian, even as they diverged radically in tone, aesthetics, and politics.", "Mission Drift is, as Chavkin also pointed out, a Western, one that links disparate elements together to pose a vexing problem\u2013perhaps the most vexing problem facing our society today.", "It was the novelist Chad Harbach, lately the lauded author of The Art of Fielding, who posed it to me years ago in a Seattle bar: \"What if growth itself is the problem?\"", "And beyond all of that is the fact that it's just a damn fine story.", "\"It is by far and away the most emotional of any of our works.", "It's, sort of\u2013separate from the politics for a minute\u2013it's just an incredibly emotional story, because we tell the story of capitalism in this country through the lens of a marriage dissolving, and a marriage that you really love,\" Chavkin said.", "\"And now I hope we've done a really good job of allowing you to fall in love with these characters and root for them, in the way you sort of root for this American thing of setting out for the territories.", "And then they just become horrible, and monsters of themselves and lost within that.\"", "Tagged with: apap

What defines American capitalism specifically and why did it become that way?'\"", "That's a hell of subject for a play to tackle, but based on my experience catching it as a work-in-progress at the 2010 Ice Factory Festival\u2026well, while I reserve the right to change my opinion based on the final version going up at COIL, I've previously described it as one of the smartest pieces of political theater I've seen in a while.", "And I'll stand by that for now.", "Fun, engaging, intelligent, non-didactic, and touching in a surprisingly humane way (given the stated subject), it challenges the standard for political theater in America and is one of the shows I'm most excited to see this January.", "The TEAM coalesced around Chavkin back in December 2004, mainly consisting of fellow NYU alums.", "The name was originally based on Chavkin's college nickname (I did not get that story) but, following the advice of an accountant from the Field who said they'd never be able to incorporate a company named \"The Team,\" the company decided to make it an acronym.", "In fact, the first group writing assignment was to come up with what \"team\" stood for, and the combined result was the portentous \"Theater of the Emerging American Moment.\"", "Today, the company has nearly doubled in size, mainly with other NYU-trained artists but also including a couple designers with experience at the SITI Company, owing no doubt to Chavkin's further training at Columbia with Anne Bogart.", "Chavkin serves as artistic director of the company and the director of the company's shows, though, given the collaborative nature of the endeavor, she describes herself as an \"editor,\" bringing together the disparate strands developed through the generative process.", "The TEAM's Rachel Chavkin and Amber Gray, with the Edinburgh Fringe Herald Angel Award they won for \"Mission Drift.\"", "Mission Drift is the sort of play that suffers in description.", "Essentially, it tells the story of two couples.", "The first is Joris and Catalina Rapelje, a fictionalized version of the couple known proverbially as the American Adam and Eve.", "Married in the Netherlands in 1624, the couple moved the North America the same year and ultimately settled in New Amsterdam, where they're credited with giving birth to the first European child in the city; today they count some one million Americans as descendants.", "In Mission Drift, the two exist as perpetual adolescents who set out from New Amsterdam in the Seventeenth Century and follow the westward expansion until 1890, when the Census declared the \"end of the frontier,\" with all supposedly \"vacant\" land in the United States settled.", "The two find themselves left in the city of Las Vegas, where they set out to create a new frontier through capitalist enterprise.", "Joan is a native of present-day Las Vegas, consigned to working odd service sector jobs while engaging in a form of urban archaeology by preserving the ever disposed signage of the strip as a volunteer at the \"Neon Boneyard,\" an amateur museum experiment I was surprised to discover is real.", "(Sadly, apparently, others have, too; according to Chavkin, when the company visited a couple years ago it was still below the radar.", "Recently though she heard from a friend there that the city's Office of Cultural Affairs had learned of it and, unintentionally echoing a line from the play, the friend told Chavkin that they \"looked at the Neon Boneyard and saw dollar signs.\")", "Joan's erstwhile love-interest is a member of the Southern Paiute tribe displaced by development, forced out of his home by the city pursuing the water rights to his family's well.", "What ultimately unfolds is a drama of conflicting interests, with Catalina occupying the role of frontiersman, longing for the possibility of new discovery and in love with power of creation to cultivate the emptiness of the American desert.", "Her path is related to the rapacious capitalism Joris indulges, but whereas he's in love with the accumulation of wealth, she's is driven by a different need, and this conflict ultimately draws them apart.", "For Chris, the Paiute, either way, the city they've built as developers has displaced him (and whoever said the desert was empty, anyway?) and he rebels against the very existence of Las Vegas.", "Joan, a non-aboriginal native of the constructed city, finds herself displaced from her own home through the rapacious development of the Rapeljes (mirroring, of course, the real estate bubble that popped shortly after the TEAM began the project).", "Oh, and Mission Drift is also a musical.", "Of a non-traditional sort.", "With performances and music by the amazing Heather Christian as Miss Atomic.", "Got all that?", "\"I think our endless process\u2013and probably endlessly frustrating process\u2013is one of the things that gives our work the density that I hope people associate with our plays,\" Chavkin told me.", "The TEAM's work is devised through a lengthy and intense process.", "I asked Chavkin to describe the process of developing the final work, and for simplicity's sake, she limited her explanation to the character of Joan, by way of example.", "Beginning at an early workshop at the Brick Theater in 2009, four of the company members were working on different things.", "Jess Almasy was interested in developing a character who believed she was Joan of Arc, envisioning the role as a Wisconsin transplant to Vegas.", "Jill Frutkin was interested in the issue of prostitution, and discovered an organization called Hookers for Jesus, comprised of born-again former prostitutes seeking to help others leave the profession.", "Libby King was fascinated with Hunter S. Thompson.", "And Kristen Sieh was interested in playing a tumbleweed, or desert native.", "The name \"Joan\" stuck, elements of one or another enterprise went into the final character\u2013a Vegas/desert native, volunteer at the Neon Boneyard, and a theme-restaurant waitress\u2013while others went by the wayside or were incorporated into other characters (the Rapeljes became the immigrants to Vegas).", "I knew that an important part of the development had taken place in Las Vegas itself, but when I asked Chavkin who had supported their residency and work on the ground, I got an emphatic \"No one.\"", "\"We fundraised like fucking crazy and we tried for support,\" she said.", "\"And now I'm thrilled to say we just got a grant from the NEA to bring the final work back to Vegas.\"", "Ultimately the company paid out of pocket or relied on donations to spend a month in the city, and in her role as director-cum-editor, Chavkin arranged a tight schedule of \"field trips\" to experience the place in the mornings, followed by intensive work in the theater the University of Las Vegas donated for their use in the afternoons.", "In their field trips, they met with and interviewed members of the local culinary workers' union, to get a sense of the labor reality in Vegas.", "They visited the Atomic Testing Museum (the testing of the bomb also figures apocalyptically in the play).", "Another trip took them to the Springs Preserve, an institution devoted to the history of the desert ecology and sustainable development, which ultimately features prominently into the work's theme.", "\"Las Vegas\u2013which I actually didn't know before we started this piece\u2013used to be a fertile valley,\" Chavkin told me.", "\"It means 'the meadows.'", "And it was totally green, totally lush.", "It was an oasis.", "And that was due to the Springs Reserve, which was the aquifer underground that got destroyed in the Fifties, it was tapped out very, very quickly.\"", "Another exercise took them to the Luxor casino, where each member's assignment was to interview three people: an employee, an apparent non-employee, and then whoever they wanted.", "The intense engagement with the city had a profound impact on the story that the company finally presented in Mission Drift.", "\"The entire way we portray Las Vegas, I can trace it back to a couple interviews we did,\" she recalled.", "\"One was with a guy who worked at the culinary union who turned out to have been born and bred in Las Vegas.", "He was about sixty, as was the head of the office of Cultural Affairs for the city, also in her early sixties.", "Both of them born and raised in Las Vegas.", "Very unusual because Las Vegas was a town of about 300,000 for a long period of time.", "And we heard from both of them almost the exact same thing, which was, this this used to be a small western town.", "This used to be a small town.", "Vegas used to be for the locals.", "It was this phrase we just kept hearing again and again and again.", "And when we asked about the destruction that had been wrought by the mortgage crisis, every single one of them said, 'We think growth is good.", "And we don't think growth is bad, we think it's good that Vegas is growing as a city.", "We just think it grew too fast.'", "So I think the entire thesis of the play, that there is something unsustainable about the marriage of capitalism and the frontier, came from right there.\"", "The one caveat I'd really like to add to all this is that, notwithstanding the influence of thinkers like Naomi Klein on the work, the reason I have so much respect for this play is that the TEAM is so decidedly opposed to easy answers.", "No matter what you ultimately think of Klein's work, she is rather easily caricatured as a leftist taking potshots at ideological enemies.", "The TEAM are not.", "Their entire portrayal of the shape of American capitalism through the stories they tell is deeply sensitive and avoids easy answers or taking potshots.", "Intelligently, the company appears to have jointly come together in an effort to present the shape of our economy\u2013including its disastrous boom-and-bust destructiveness\u2013as a function of something deeper in the American psyche, the longing for creating things, for expanding the frontiers and filling the empty spaces our European ancestors imagined the deserts and plains and mountains of the frontier to be.", "Watching it the first time, I was struck by the thematic similarity between Mission Drift and Cormac McCarthy's remarkable novel Blood Meridian, even as they diverged radically in tone, aesthetics, and politics.", "Mission Drift is, as Chavkin also pointed out, a Western, one that links disparate elements together to pose a vexing problem\u2013perhaps the most vexing problem facing our society today.", "It was the novelist Chad Harbach, lately the lauded author of The Art of Fielding, who posed it to me years ago in a Seattle bar: \"What if growth itself is the problem?\"", "And beyond all of that is the fact that it's just a damn fine story.", "\"It is by far and away the most emotional of any of our works.", "It's, sort of\u2013separate from the politics for a minute\u2013it's just an incredibly emotional story, because we tell the story of capitalism in this country through the lens of a marriage dissolving, and a marriage that you really love,\" Chavkin said.", "\"And now I hope we've done a really good job of allowing you to fall in love with these characters and root for them, in the way you sort of root for this American thing of setting out for the territories.", "And then they just become horrible, and monsters of themselves and lost within that.\"", "Tagged with: apap

She collaborated closely with the production and costume designers, and learnt to bake pies and prepare chickens. The broadcast received a limited audience but gained positive reviews. Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon called the series a \"quiet, heartbreaking masterpiece\" and described Winslet's performance as \"terrific\u2014intelligent, focused and seemingly devoid of ego\". She received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress, in addition to Golden Globe and SAG Award wins. \n The ensemble thriller \"Contagion\" from Steven Soderbergh was Winslet's first film release of 2011. She was cast as a disease detective for the CDC, and she modelled her role on Anne Schuchat, the director of the NCIRD. \"Contagion\" was a commercial success."}}

Originally offered a 6pm slot, the band already had commitments in Ireland and therefore requested an earlier slot. Their request was rejected by the organisers as there were no available slots. \n There were speculations by the press that English girl group the Spice Girls would reunite for a Live 8 performance, in what would have been their first appearance as a five-piece since May 1998. At the Live 8 launch in May, Bob Geldof confirmed that organisers were trying to get the group to reform for the event. Ultimately, the Live 8 reunion did not materialise due to a holdout by Spice Girl Mel B. "}}
