News, Top Stories,", "For Axle Whitehead one of the more bizarre contrasts of filming The Wall in Poland was during his downtime.", "One day he was giving away thousands of cash filming Seven's new shiny floor game show.", "The next he was visiting Auschwitz concentration camp near Krakow.", "\"It was a life-changing experience,\" he tells TV Tonight.", "\"(Auschwitz) was not that long ago.", "And just to see what humans can do to each other\u2026. the men had 9-5 jobs with their wives at home and went to the concentration camp to do their 10 hour shift and went back home.", "What was going on was just horrific.", "\"I don't know a lot about war history, so I just found that fascinating.\"", "When he wasn't delving into history, Whitehead was getting up to speed on Seven's new show, the first show he has hosted in a decade, and the first in the game show genre.", "Since he wrapped on Home & Away in 2012, Whitehead has been largely based in the US, scoring a recurring role on both Shameless and Marvel's Agents of SHIELD.", "Returning home for Seven he is the smiling host of mega-show The Wall, in which contestants compete for millions of dollars (as much as $12m is on offer).", "But with its 4-storey wall resembling a giant arcade game, production took place on one of 3 existing sets (US and France are the other 2).", "\"It was probably cheaper to fly everyone over there,\" he admits when I ask why Seven didn't construct an Australian set.", "\"When we got there Russia was shooting their first season.", "So we watched a bit of that, which was weird.", "And after that was Romania, Hungary and I think Czech Republic.", "\"We were kind of on the fly.", "Everyone was learning it together.", "When I used to host Video Hits for Channel TEN a few years ago, I was kind of involved in the production side because it was such a small team.\"", "Describing the production period as \"land, rehearse, shoot, get out,\" Whitehead familiarised himself with the format playing the game with a DVD in his hotel, prior to set rehearsals.", "In addition to a largely Polish crew and interpreters, the crowd comprised English speaking audience & ex-pats.", "\"So it was an interesting language barrier,\" he muses.", "\"But I had an absolute blast.\"", "\"The contestants \u2026.. are not 'game-show whores.'\"", "The US format show has screened in 15 countries, with the US version hosted by Chris Hardwick.", "In its first episode, a whopping $240,000 was given away to 2 Queensland parents.", "\"The show is about giving good opportunities to good people.", "So the contestants are people who do things for the community, maybe face adversity or family struggles, and people who are not 'game-show whores.'", "\"Money doesn't define who they are.\"", "In addition to its trivia, luck and risk, couples can wager their winnings, sight unseen for much more.", "Whitehead's elaborate explanation of the gameplay was accompanied with an assurance that things are much easier to view than to explain.", "\"At the end of round 3 the person behind the wall has to make a decision whether to sign a contract for the guaranteed amount that they have at the end of round 1 or they can tear it up for what is potentially left on the wall at the end of round 3.", "But they have no idea what that amount is.\"", "He also took the view that the show doesn't trade on exploiting the 'worthiness' of 'bleeding-heart contestants.", "\"The second episode is 2 cops, where 1 is a detective and the other was the first female to be accepted into the bomb squad.", "So they don't necessarily have any adversity, they just do a lot for the community,\" he assured.", "\"We have no control over the balls.\"", "Finally, with $12m on offer each game, how confident is he of not sending the network bankrupt?", "Just how fair and balanced is the gameplay?", "\"I asked all of these questions,\" he insists.", "\"We have no control over the balls.", "Obviously with the trivia that has to be locked away and verified and that's very strict.", "\"But the balls, there is literally no way of controlling them.", "They weigh 1.5kilos in a bowling ball-shape.", "Having some of the Channel Seven guys there recording they were (very nervous).", "\"I was watching the balls behave wondering if there was any way to rig them?", "But I've held them, put them in the chute, seen them drop time and time again, but there is no way.", "\"Guaranteed.\"", "The Wall returns 7:30pm tonight and continues Sunday & Monday on Seven.", "### Related", "### Related", "Next post \u00bb\u00ab

Schoenberg had invented to do away with conventional harmony.", "On his own, Cage drafted a collective of bookbinders (with whom he shared a house in Santa Monica) into a percussion ensemble and wrote pieces for them that applied Schoenberg's structural principals to rhythmic cells.", "Schoenberg, however, thought this of little interest.", "Fed up with repeatedly having to study the composer's harmony textbook, \"Harmonielehre,\" Cage dropped out of Schoenberg's UCLA class in 1936 after having devoted himself to the master for nearly two years.", "Still the young composer continued to, as he put it, worship Schoenberg like a god.", "He took away from Schoenberg the idea that a composer always needed some kind of system.", "And Cage always came up with one.", "## Complicated love life",

find his voice, and it would be hard to imagine that happening in quite the same way anyplace else.", "One inspiration was the animator Oskar Fischinger .", "A German \u00e9migr\u00e9 whose application of classical music to abstract imagery was one of the models for the Disney film \"Fantasia,\" Fischinger practiced Buddhism and further paved the way for Cage's later fascination with Zen.", "He also provided Cage with a model for eloquent graphic notation, which would become another Cagean hallmark.", "Next, Cage accompanied dance at UCLA either on the piano or with percussion, and he assisted his Aunt Phoebe in her music education classes at UCLA's progressive elementary school on Sunset Boulevard.", "For an aquatic ballet, Cage came up with the idea of a dipping a gong into the pool so the swimmers could hear it underwater.", "The water gong was the first among a great many original sound-producing contraptions the son of an inventor would devise throughout his career.", "His teaching was equally revolutionary.", "He put together a list of 10 \"Rules and Hints for Student and Teachers, or Anybody Else.\"", "Rule 4 is \"Consider everything an experiment.\"", "Rule 6 begins \"Nothing is a mistake.\"", "Rule 9 advises \"Be happy whenever you can manage it.\"", "Rule 10 advocates breaking all the rules, \"even our own rules.\"", "It was at the UCLA elementary school where Cage first experimented with placing household objects on or in between the strings of the piano to create a new percussion effect.", "Around the time of his 26th birthday, Cage took a job as a dance accompanist at the Cornish School in Seattle, where he claimed to have invented the prepared piano, in which he inserted nut and bolts, screws and rubber erasers inside the piano.", "This radically changed the nature of the piano, turning it into a gently startling one-man percussion band, and it was one of the things for which he became known.", "But the prepared piano's origins were decidedly on Sunset Boulevard.", "## His final companion", "After two years in Seattle, a year in the San Francisco Bay Area and a year in Chicago, Cage moved to New York.", "He and Kashevaroff divorced after 10 years of marriage, and Cage spent the rest of his life with dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, whom he had met at Cornish.", "### Events:", "Remembering John

New York during the last four years of Cage's life and spent as much time around him as I could.", "He had felt I might make a good biographer for a biography he didn't really want written.", "But he did seem almost obsessed with youth.", "He particularly liked to speak about his father, whom he adored but hardly knew.", "When Milton was busy on an invention, he might not emerge from his laboratory for days on end.", "And Cage acknowledged that this led him to seek out father figures, such as Schoenberg and Duchamp.", "Nor did he ever stop trying to prove himself to Schoenberg.", "A system he called anarchic harmony, upon which he based his late music, was his answer to his old teacher.", "During Cage's final summer, he even began rereading the Austrian master's \"Harmonielehre.\"", "Shortly before Cage suffered his fatal stroke, I happened to call his assistant, the Cage authority Laura Kuhn, who now heads the John Cage Trust at Bard College in New York.",

The task force produced two reports making recommendations to the Governor on what could be done to enhance broadband in California, engaging in a broadband mapping project for California, and producing a broadband speed report. In response to the Task Force mapping project and report, the CPUC launched an innovative California Advanced Services Fund (CASF), which is an infrastructure grant program for deploying broadband in unserved areas of California.

interactive data visualization interface designed to engage building occupants and provide insights into personalized data; and curated monthly operations and energy reports for Chief Engineers, Finance and Ops Managers to gain visibility into asset performance and uptime and offer recommendations for adjustments to improve operational and energy performance.", "While it's started with energy consumption analytics at this stage, using its IoT hardware and AI software to improve in-building intelligence for facilities managers, the ultimate aim is to offer even more algorithmic automation down the line, by adding and automating controls.", "Chung says Verdigris sees its biggest growth potential in: \"Developing control features or integrating them through partnerships\".", "\"We feel

With his defeat in Ashgrove beyond doubt even though counting had not been finalised, Newman announced his retirement from politics on election night. He immediately resigned as both premier and LNP leader, though he remained as caretaker premier for nearly two weeks while the overall result was in doubt.

Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars.

sheriff deputies in the department have for years been subjected to heavy workloads and mandatory overtime, prompting many to quit and take up jobs in other counties, according to information obtained from agency records.", "Sixty-six sheriff deputies have quit within the last six years, including three who left in the first week of this month -- Byron Simms, Mark Roccaporiore and Howard Ferguson.", "Twenty-four civilians also left -- including Anitra Jenkens, a public safety staff who also left in the first week of this month, according to the agency's data.", "While some of the personnel routinely retired, majority of the deputies left to other agencies due to the additional workload imposed on them in an administrative effort to make up for the vacancies.", "\"Some of them

therefore they become discouraged because this [mandatory overtime] doesn't give them much time to do anything.\"", "At least 20 deputies have left since Black was elected to head the county agency in November 1998, according to department statistics obtained by The Star.", "The agency had 284 sworn deputies and civilian personnel in December 1994.", "As of Wednesday, 192 personnel -- 138 deputies and 54 civilians -- were left, according to the department's data.", "Thousands of warrant orders are issued annually by judges in the county courts.", "For instance, the department received 29,064

problem of the sheriff department can be traced to pending litigation in Charles County that started in the Prince George's County Circuit Court with four separate parties.", "After the county executive decided to slash the department's budget for the fiscal year starting July 1, 1996, then County Sheriff James Aluisi reassigned sheriff deputies from serving \"take-up\" warrants to landlords and tenants to focus on domestic violence cases.", "\"I chose to have my deputies focus on areas where safety and lives of people were involved, rather than serve eviction notices,\" Aluisi said Wednesday.", "\"It's not true that the county was having financial problem because other agencies kept their budget while I had a 40 percent reduction of my budget, and the county's financial officer testified in court that there were funds.\"", "Months before the 1996 fiscal year started, Southern Management -- owners of a county apartment complex -- sued the sheriff department and the office of the county executive for failure to serve warrants for eviction notices promptly, making it difficult for them and other landlords to remove defaulting tenants.", "They argued that they were losing money because the affected tenants lived in the apartment without paying their rents.", "Aluisi responded by suing the office of the county executive for not providing him with adequate funds needed to hire enough personnel for the department.", "The apartment owners later withdrew the suit against the county when the office of the county executive explained to them that the sheriff department had enough funds to serve the warrants since the budget cut would not be effective until July, according to county attorney Sean Wallace.", "The office of the county executive then counter", "sued the sheriff department and the state separately.", "In one suit, it alleged that Aluisi was mismanaging the department.", "In the other suit, it insisted that the state was responsible for paying the services of sheriff deputies in the courthouse.", "\"I found out that the state of Maryland was legislatively responsible to pay the cost of security in the District Court since 1971, but the people of Prince George's County have been paying the cost of District Court security,\" County Executive Wayne Curry said Jan. 10.", "\"We are the only jurisdiction treated that way, so I went [to Annapolis] and asked for help, for the state to pay its fair share of the cost of District Court cost.\"", "In 1997, Judge Steven Chappelle, a judge in Charles County, was brought in to handle the case since he was not from the county.", "Chappelle ruled at the Prince George's County Circuit Court that the county was liable for the court costs for sheriff deputies.", "The county appealed, and in June the Appeals Court ruled that while the county was responsible for paying sheriff deputies for serving warrants, the state was responsible for paying for the courthouse security provided by sheriff deputies.", "The order required the state to pay the county more than $100,000 annually in payment dating back to 1971, and to pay for future security provided by the deputies from July 1999.", "The state filed a motion challenging that ruling by the Appeals Court.", "Chappelle will hear the state's motion on Feb. 23 in Charles County Circuit Court.", "Meanwhile, the case against Sheriff Aluisi automatically ended when Black succeeded Aluisi 14 months ago.", "\"It's very distressing because we cannot move the Sheriff's Department forward in dealing with a lot of the warrants and a lot of the vital things that must be taken care of by the department,\" said Del. Joanne C. Benson (D-Dist. 24) of Landover, chair of the county's law enforcement committee, which oversees the salaries of the sheriff department.", "Benson said.", "\"It's very difficult to do it when you don't have adequate staffing but because of the litigation and the way its been handled in court right now they cannot hire the people to do the job.\"", "Black said that despite a problem he described as \"very challenging\" because of the suit that has left him with inadequate personnel, he has accomplished a lot in the area of serving warrants.", "Out of 29,064 criminal warrant orders issued in 1999, 27,501 were served, according to the sheriff department's statistics dated January 5.", "Also, 71 percent of the 6,200 warrant orders issued for domestic violence cases last year were served, while six of the warrants were recalled by the court, according to Sgt. Bill Ament, public information officer at the sheriff department.", "The court recalled six warrants and the Warrants Review Board disposed of 96 warrants, Ament said of the board set up by Sheriff Black to examine the validity of outstanding warrants.", "\"The reality is that we started this initiative with close to 40,000 warrants in January 1999, now we have about 38,000,\" Ament said.", "\"That doesn't sound significant until you consider how much work and personnel are needed to execute one warrant.\"", "When Aliusi sued the county five years ago, his relationship with County Executive Curry went sour.", "On Jan. 10, Curry and Aluisi's successor [Black] hugged publicly and announced that they have formed a new partnership that would resolve the problem.", "\"The new sheriff and I hopefully will be the beneficiary of this unified approach to fairness, to equity and to justice.\"", "Black said he has formed an alliance with Curry and the county council to resolve staffing problems in his department, adding that more computers are being installed at the department to upgrade its technology.", "\"I anticipate that between now and June we'll be hiring more deputies and administrative personnel to enhance the manpower we need,\" Black said.", "## Top Jobs", "See all jobs", "## Search Directories", "Search all directories", "Place a classifieds ad now", "## Resources", "About us", "Contact us", "Gazette jobs", "Prince George's", "## Search Directories", "Search all directories", "or pick a category below to search now", "Pick One", "Childcare Assistance", "Childcare Wanted", "Convalescent Home Offered", "Convalescent Home Wanted", "Day Camps", "Domestic Help Wanted", "Domestic Services Offered", "Music Instruction"], "meta": {"id": "train26109-2", "claim_title": "Prince George's County Sheriff's Office", "claim_section": "History.:1994\u20132000: Funding cuts and vacancies.", "claim_context": "From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or civilian employees, leaving the agency with 92 vacant positions that needed to be filled.

In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, the agency had 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000. In July 1996, the county government decreased the amount of funding the PGSO was receiving. Unlike the PGPD at the time, the PGSO was not nationally accredited and still is not, as of January 2015.

With Chief Justice Roger Taney sitting as judge, the Federal District Court of Maryland struck down the suspension in \"Ex parte Merryman\", although Lincoln ignored the order. \n President Franklin Delano Roosevelt similarly invoked emergency powers when he issued an order directing that all Japanese Americans residing on the West Coast be placed into internment camps during World War II.

garners an appreciation for the inventors of the ages and those who risked their lives fighting the fires to keep us safe.", "It seems that as soon as man created fire, he just as quickly discovered how to put it out.", "Well before a conduit was invented, man literally carried water to fires by hand.", "This led to the realization that if a vessel could carry a lot of water, the fire would be extinguished faster.", "Thus, bags made from ox gut were born, and their existence was documented as early as 400 B.C., in which the bags were filled, then stomped on, blasting the water out of the bag and onto the fire.", "A colonial bucket brigade (courtesy of FASNY Museum of Firefighting)", "Around 1673, Dutch painter, inventor, and printmaker, Jan van der Heyden and his son produced what they referred to as \" fire hose\".", "Interestingly, they sewed leather tubes together in 50 foot lengths, which is still considered a standard length to this day.", "This allowed fire fighters to get closer to the fire, which enabled them to aim and shoot the stream precisely where they wanted it.", "Jan van der Heyden also wrote the first firefighting manual: Brandspuiten-boek.", "In the early 1800's, hydrants, tanks, and cisterns were used, and nozzles were designed to further improve water flow characteristics.", "One problem that surfaced early on and plagued early fire hoses was leakage.", "The stitches that connected the leather leaked and after a while the leather itself began to seep water.", "The introduction of pump action tankers led to over pressure in which the hose would burst.", "Rivets were introduced in 1807 and were applied to the thickest part or rear quarters of the cowhides.", "This made the hose almost leak proof, however it added significant weight.", "A 40 to 50 foot length of hose weighed upwards of 85 pounds.", "The leather hose required a good deal of maintenance much as it still does today.", "Early leather hose was treated with fish and whale oil to help preserve it.", "A two-cylinder steam fire engine, late 1800s in Aurora, IN", "In 1821, James Boyd patented rubber lined, woven jacketed fire hose.", "In those early days of modern fire hose the jackets were made from spun cotton.", "Akron Ohio's own Charles Goodyear discovered the vulcanization process, and applied that to rubber hose, reinforced with cotton ply.", "Through the subsequent decades to follow, fire hose has undergone monumental changes.", "The jackets are now polyester woven yarn, treated to resist mold, mildew and abrasion.", "The rubber extrusion process has advanced to the point that it really cannot be improved upon.", "A conduit will always be required to move \"the wet stuff to the hot stuff\" unless someone can devise a way to teleport it.", "One can only wonder, what improvements and developments lie ahead?", "Oh, yes, which brings me to the namesake of Rawhide Fire Hose.", "In recent history of fire hose, bucket brigades were used by townspeople in attempt to extinguish fires.", "The buckets were made of leather and primarily used to water horses.", "Leather tubes emerged as a more effective and accurate way to battle fires.", "Leather is known to be tough, yet flexible making for a good way to carry that water to the fire.", "Leather is also known as \u2026\u2026Rawhide.", "For those of you of the vintage to remember the television

Original hand pumpers discharged their water through a small pipe or monitor attached to the top of the pump tub. It was not until the late 1860s that hoses became widely available to convey water more easily from the hand pumps, and later steam pumpers, to the fire. \n In Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, Jan van der Heyden, and his son Nicholaas took firefighting to its next step with the fashioning of the first fire hose in 1673.

The triangle still hangs in the prison at the centre where the wings meet on a metal gate. It is no longer used, though the hammer to beat it is mounted beside it. \nIn the original play by Brendan Behan, the song is written as the \"old triangle\" not \"auld triangle\". \n The triangle was rung regularly to signify points in the prisons routine. \n A second level of meaning is hinted at in the final verse in which the singer imagines himself dwelling in the women's prison. Another mourns the separation from ''his girl Sal\". These hint at the internal erotic fantasies that prisoners  use to separate themselves from the harsh prison environment. In this meaning, the old triangle becomes the female pudenda."}}

In 1880, the club adopted its present name and moved to the Cliftonville Cricket Ground on the Cliftonville Road, where it played until 1972. In that year, the club was forced to vacate the ground after a series of sectarian attacks against members and the looting and burning of the clubhouse by a hostile mob. The 1973 season was played at Mossley, 1974 at Shaw's Bridge, Belfast, and in 1975 the club found a permanent base at Mallusk. \n In 1979, Cliftonville merged with Greenisland Cricket Club (founded 1930), continuing to play at Mallusk until a move to new facilities at Greenisland in 1990. In 2007, however, the owners of the Greenisland pitch, Greenisland War Memorial Sports Club, decided to replace the cricket pitch with an artificial hockey pitch and for the 2008 season, Cliftonville had to play all its matches away from home. Since 2009, the club has returned to Mallusk. "}}

curated crawls of the live web using a simple web application with partner/tech support.", "Launching Archive-It meant we could help our colleagues create their own web collections for their own

The paper proposed the use of accelerometers and a bumping gesture of two devices to enable communication, screen sharing and content transfer between them. Similar to this original concept, the idea for Bump app was conceived by David Lieb, a former employee of Texas Instruments, while he was attending the University of Chicago Booth School of Business for his MBA. While going through the orientation and meeting process of business school, he became frustrated by constantly entering contact information into his iPhone and felt that the process could be improved. His fellow Texas Instruments employees Andy Huibers and Jake Mintz, who was a classmate of Lieb\u2019s at the University of Chicago\u2019s MBA program, joined Lieb to form Bump Technologies. Bump Technologies launched in 2008."}}

Trevorrow had told the filmmakers, \"if I direct this screenplay, it's going to be a bad movie. I'm gonna do a bad job, because I just don't get it.\" Trevorrow and Connolly wrote their own draft of the script over a couple of weeks. The studio received the draft on May 6, 2013, and found the script changes more large-scale than anticipated. On May 8, 2013, the studio announced it was pushing the release from June 13, 2014, to an unspecified future date. Filming had been set to begin on June 24, 2013. Delaying the film allowed Trevorrow and Connolly more time to work on the script, as Spielberg felt that it needed improvement. Another reason for the delay was to allow time for the construction of practical sets for the fictional theme park; it was previously intended to add in these buildings using computer effects. "}}

added?", "Earlier, you mentioned making things easier to understand\u2026", "Yasuhiro Wada: \"In Birthdays the Beginning, I wanted to make something that was very simple, but rather than a game, if ended up feeling more like a simulator.", "That is great for people who enjoy things playing out in front of them, but I received requests and feedback for more game-like elements.", "That's why this time clear objectives have been provided.\"", "4Gamer: And that is the Happy Star system, then.", "Wada: \"That's right.", "In the previous game, by picking up randomly spawned items, it would drastically change the environment in some way, but this time it has all been changed to \"Skills\".", "Star Energy is required to use Skills, and by progressing in the game, it slowly builds up.\"", "Later on, Wada discussed the addition of a Navigation System to the game which tells players the exact requirements to get particular creature species, and the different mindset that the current generation of gamers have compared to his more old-school way of thinking.", "4Gamer: Oh, that's true.", "I remember needing to go through a lot of trial-and-error in Birthdays the Beginning.", "Wada: \"The game was designed that way not out of malicious intent, but so that players would not be confused by too much information at once, which was why as much was hidden as possible.", "However, in the end it just led to the difficulty of the game increasing.", "With the Navigation System, you are able to see all the information needed for particular living creatures to be born.\"", "4Gamer:", "So it's now easier to aim for particular creatures.", "Still, I feel that it might be too forgiving now.", "Isn't there fun in finding out the particular requirements for yourself?", "Wada: \"That's right.", "I felt the same way, and in the previous game, I couldn't get out of that particular way of thinking.", "However, that might be an outdated way of looking at things.", "The goal of this game is to have as many people play the game as possible, so in order to better match the tastes of current gamers, all the information is displayed.", "This is because the core part of the game isn't in that aspect, and so it's not like the game will be less fun as a result.\"", "Finally, Wada revealed a bit about why he left both Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture to create Toybox.", "4Gamer: What caused you to leave Marvelous?", "Wada: \"While I felt that game creation was my job, Marvelous operates on a hierarchy of experience, and gradually I was forced to take a more managing role.", "Then, I was completely cut off from developing games myself, and was stuck in a dilemma.", "During this situation, Goichi Suda from Grasshopper Manufacture invited me to make games together, and I changed companies.\"", "4Gamer: That's right, before Toybox, you worked at Grasshopper Manufacture.", "Wada: \"Yes.", "Around that period of time, Grasshopper was making several big titles like Shadow of the Damned and Lollipop Chainsaw.", "Although I changed companies in order to go hands-on with development, with the abundance of creators already at Grasshopper I ended up taking a managerial role.\"", "4Gamer: So you couldn't develop games like you wanted to.", "Wada: \"With that experience, I realized that at my age and with my resume I would end up taking a managerial role no matter what.", "Yet I still wanted to make games, so I thought that the only way would be to create my own company, which we now know as Toybox.\"", "It is interesting to contrast Wada's experience in hindsight with his statements from back when he worked at Grasshopper, in an interview with Siliconera back in 2010.", "He also talked about his game creation philosophy in an Ask-Me-Anything on Reddit in 2016.", "Happy Birthdays releases in North America on June 5, 2018 for Nintendo Switch.", "It releases in Europe on June 8, and a few months earlier in Japan on March 29.", "Read more

The company is headed by Goichi Suda, also known as Suda51, and is noted for its original and imaginative titles - ones that are also fraught with financial risk. Potential losses are often made up by the development of games based on popular anime franchises, such as \"Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked\", \"Blood+: One Night Kiss\", and \"Rebuild of Evangelion: Sound Impact\".\n In May 2007, Suda announced during a speech at the 2007 Game Developers Conference that Grasshopper was at the time working on three titles for the Wii, two of which have now been released: \"No More Heroes\" and \"Fatal Frame IV\". There is no information on the status of the third Wii game in development then. \n Grasshopper was said to be working on an Xbox 360 title, and have presented a concept for a PlayStation 3 game called \"Kurayami\", a non-linear action adventure inspired by the worrying and confused universe of the Czech writer Franz Kafka, whom Goichi Suda admires. This was later cancelled and reincorporated ideas were put into the game \"Shadows of the Damned\". \n In 2010, Yashuhiro Wada joined Grasshopper Manufacture as COO. He left Grasshopper."}}

traces the shifting role of the voice in popular music.", "By Adam Harper", "July 02, 2014", "From Kraftwerk to FKA Twigs to Hatsune Miku, what does the changing role of voice say about the modern human?", "In his monthly column System Focus, The FADER's favorite underground music critic Adam Harper stares deep into the internet's gloom to unearth emerging musical forms.", "You might say that the voice is the most human of all the elements in music.", "It comes from deep within our bodies, organically, ever since we came to be human, and indeed long before.", "It is probably the first musical instrument that we learned to recognise, and, since it is built into most of us, the first that we learn to use.", "Yet the voice is much more than just a sound, however primordial.", "It represents a person: their activity, agency, opinions, experience, their self-projection.", "In doing so, it differentiates itself from the environment around it, musical or cultural, either drawing power from this context or somehow standing against it.", "Or, most intriguingly, doing both at the same time.", "In most 20th century popular music, the role of the voice in the musical landscape was fairly clear.", "There were the vocals and there was the backing, divided into guitars, percussion, bass, riffs, solos, breaks, and even supporting vocals.", "The voice would stand out clearly and tell a story and convey a message.", "But then things got more complicated.", "The voice started to disappear into the guitars, started to drift away from clearly making sense, and started to merge with new technologies\u2014the gramophone, the microphone, distortion, the spinning Leslie speaker, the talk box, the sampler and auto-tune.", "What's more, human-like voices started coming from non-human sources, from the vocoder and speech synthesis and, more recently, vocaloids (which I'll look at later).", "Today, a major characteristic of 21st century pop music, especially underground, is the erosion of that former distinction between the human voice and the musical landscape in which it stands, especially digitally, and of which it now forms a part.", "No longer is the voice merely a figure in the landscape, but it fuses with the landscape itself.", "Not only is this sonically intriguing (appealing or disturbing, take your pick), but it has consequences for the way we consider the voice as a representation of a person in their place in the emerging digital world.", "There's a tendency to regard the digital world as non-human, as encroaching on humanity, but I think that's quite wrong.", "The internet is not just a landscape made up of technology, it is one made up of humanity.", "Like it or not, Facebook and Twitter are made of people, and of people's voices in particular.", "People's voices and the lives behind them reduced to assertions, opinions, arguments, anxieties, reduced to pieces of data, to samples\u2014but sounding out nonetheless.", "And this landscape is reflected and explored in the music it produces, where the lines between the human and its technological environment are no longer clearly drawn.", "There are still plenty of artists in whose music the voice is clear and relatively unmanipulated, but the tumultuousness of the surrounding accompaniment nevertheless suggests the voice hemmed in by busy, exotic, unfamiliar environments.", "More clearly perhaps than on any of her previous albums, Maria Minerva's Histrionic puts her voice and her persona at the centre of an idealised, impressionistic club experience teeming with delirious colour and sensation, a position somewhere between confusion and empowerment from which she addresses those around her.", "Autre Ne Veut rails grandiosely against his fears in last year's Anxiety, his voice squeezed and scrunched tightly inside its twisted pop-synth cradle.", "FKA Twigs' largely conventional and polished voice is suspended in a mysterious chamber crawling with synthesized entities on tracks like \"Two Weeks,\" as if she were the Borg Queen.", "But plenty of other artists and genres have seen the membrane between the voice and its technological environment begin to rupture.", "A continuum has been established which runs from the traditional scenario of vocals plus instrumental technologies, through sampling, chopping, screwing, the voice as an instrument, sample-based synthesis, and synthesised speech.", "Perhaps the most famous artist to have taken the voice to new places is Burial, now a huge influence on underground music, who uses speaking voices to populate his imaginary, dilapidated environments, as well as chopping and stitching singing samples together to create entirely new singing voices.", "Footwork has taken the sampling of the voice to new extremes, taking such small and repetitious slivers of it that the sense of a human performer collapses almost entirely in a cascade of vowels and consonants, taking on the same character as the accompanying drum machine.", "Following DJ Screw, Clams Casino has used voices, often slowed-down or deepened ('screwed' or 'dragged'), as a building material in his hip-hop instrumentals, often entirely removing their capacity to communicate lexical meaning in the process.", "James Ferraro has explored a quasi-naive use of auto-tune in his recent, beleaguered songs, his prone, all-too-human voice trickling over angular sculptures of digital crystal.", "Oneohtrix Point Never uses choir samples mapped to his keyboards regularly, on one occasion creating an a capella work for which, strangely, no new voices were recorded.", "Holly Herndon has used every facet of the voice in her electronic constructions\u2014her song \"Chorus\" is like a voice that has exploded and is being stitched together into a new form.", "Go deeper into the digital world and the voice finds endless new forms, further integrated into its landscape.", "Yet go deeper into the digital world and the voice finds endless new forms, further integrated into its landscape.", "I had been listening to the music of Oakland-based Nima for quite some time before I realised that her tracks, though they regularly draw on recorded vocals, are not songs per se.", "On Spirit Sign and her upcoming tape for Harsh Riddims, SEE FEEL REEL, the voice has partly receded into the musical environment, becoming part of the furniture of her airy and mysterious rooms.", "Even with words attached, her voice does not compete with percussion and keyboard riffs.", "The final tracks of both albums (called \"Landscapes\" on Spirit Sign) feature synthesised speech, as if completing a transition from human to machine, yet it's set against some of Nima's most elegant instrumental textures.", "At the end of SEE FEEL REEL, a voice almost obsessively repeats crypto-romantic refrains such as I'm... in love... with... the... digital age... over strings, before switching to breathy voice-like tones as if it were dissolving into air.", "Nima's music certainly lives in the digital age, and all the elements within it expand to fill the enormous space that results.", "spirit sign by nima", "Another producer who has been using synthesised speech is Chaz Allen as Metallic Ghosts, also well known as one of the folks behind live-streaming platform SPF420.", "Echoing Ferraro's celebrated album Far Side Virtual, where a synthesised voice appears as a touchscreen waiter and a virtual chef, Metallic Ghosts employs them on his albums The Pleasure Centre and Sky Tower 2032 as narrators and characters in a drama.", "Yet my favourite Metallic Ghosts release is the multidimensionally weird The City of Ableton, which is ostensibly just an injoke about the Ableton software used by so many producers, depicting it\u2014squarely according to neoliberal capitalist rhetoric\u2014as a city of endless possibilities.", "To do this, Allen adopts a musical style that idiosyncratically evokes the urban-planner-simulation game series Sim City, a screenshot from which provides the album's cover.", "Both musically and conceptually, the album suggests a dream cityscape as it might have appeared at the turn of the 1990s, a weird, multicoloured, postmodern union of the past and the future, where citizens of all professions glide beatifically down immaculate beige sidewalks past bright red fire stations, neo-1930s banking skyscrapers, parping bandstands, faux-eighteenth-century colleges, and green, green, lawns, all presided over by a moustachioed mayor who warmly greets his public at the exponential tree-planting and ribbon-cutting ceremonies.", "One of the crucial components of this digital landscape\u2014now looking rather misplaced, both poignant and arrogant, in the post-recession era\u2014is the voice.", "Fittingly, the vocals, and the human beings hinted at behind it, are just yet further objects swirling in the cityscape, forming its melodies, scatting ooh and aah or urging Work it! and Get down like feckless, automated cheerleaders.", "It's a landscape we might recognize and enjoy with a little disquiet mixed in.", "The technique Allen uses to deploy voices in the track \"Mass Transit\" is called sample-based synthesis, and involves inputting samples into a synthesiser so that every key plays a sample whose pitch corresponds to that key, allowing you to play a sampled vocal as if it were a piano.", "It was also used by Allen-associate Saint Pepsi on his recent EP Gin City (which is akin to a mini tour of different uses of the voice in the online underground) on the track \"Mr Wonderful.\"", "When the track's lead tune moves onto a more conventional synthesiser, the effect is not of a singer falling silent, but of a singer showing a different side to themselves.", "Sampling processes of all kinds appear in Blank Banshee's album Blank Banshee 1, a masterwork of the new digital psychedelia, and it's quite easy not to really notice that the album is filled with voices at every turn, much like its videos are filled with virtual beings, objects and environments.", "Despite the fact that these voices are pitched up, down and all around, they're never more than virtual avatars of their owners: social media masks that are both freeing and constraining.", "Freeing in that they allow the voice to move to new places and be new people, constraining in that these surrogate people are not yet as infinitely flexible and free as they would like to think they are, and might still have an air of the uncanny about them.", "This double-edged nature of the human user in the modern digital playground, its mixture of strange new opportunities and dangers, might be why one of the tracks goes by the name \"Anxiety Online.\"", "But not all digital voices have flesh and blood humans directly behind them.", "With synthesised speech, the voice is the digital landscape.", "Wholly synthesised speech has been around for decades, appearing on Kraftwerk records of the 1970s in roles such as the voice of energy... a giant electricity generator.", "But in the past decade, an entire subculture (mostly confined to Japan but with strong showings in Europe and North America) has grown up around a software series that synthesises song: vocaloids.", "Developed by Yamaha and produced mainly by the brilliantly named Japanese company Crypton Future Media, vocaloids offer the user the chance to create a voice that can sing both melodies and lyrics, based on 'sound banks' recorded by human singers (so really, they're a kind of sample-based synthesis).", "They appear in a wide range of different voices, languages and genders, and one of the most interesting things about them is that they are personified with given names, images (which typically appear on album covers), even ages and weights.", "As such, they are treated much like the J-pop idols they emulate.", "Disconcertingly, there are far more female vocaloids than male ones, and they are invariably more popular\u2014probably because women are more likely to be treated as objects, even technological ones (for example, in films from Metropolis through to Spike Jonze's recent Her, about a man who falls in love with a speaking operating system).", "The most popular vocaloid is Hatsune Miku [pictured above], whose name means something like 'first sound of the future.'", "First released in 2007, her success greatly expanded the profile of vocaloids, eventually causing vocaloid compilation albums featuring her, such as Exit Tunes Presents:

flutes (you might know it from the opening to \"Strawberry Fields Forever\").", "Both dolls designed to emulate more organic musics, the vocaloid and mellotron complement one another not as fake, insufficient, robotic entities, but as toys that have run away to a miniature fantasy kingdom where they can now be loved only by history and nature.", "It won't be long, then, before the vocaloids

It has large segmental headed windows, subtle architectural detailing, and relief panels advertising the name and trademarks of the firm. Hale built his daughter Doris a new house in Snaithing Park Road, near to his own, upon her marriage in 1921 to Maurice Cole of the Cole Brothers department store. \n Hale's final career phase was between 1926 and his death in 1929, during which time he constructed five churches in a strong geometric modern style, with little historical detailing. It has been suggested that Hale's plain style to his work in this period reflects the sobriety that followed World War I. This is best illustrated at Banner Cross Methodist Church which resembles a huge war memorial not unlike a cenotaph. "}}

"Tickled begins as an innocuous look into amateur competitive tickle videos online, an obvious minor fetish industry that swears by its integrity as legitimate sport.", "A curious New Zealand journalist is then beset by homophobic harassment, personal attacks, and legal threats, which only makes him more determined to unravel the source of these tickle videos.", "It reminds me of 2010's Catfish except this story actually has the stakes that film ultimately lacked.", "It's an investigative piece of journalism that involves working through false identities, spooked video participants that have had their lives ruined from persecution, interviewing lackeys on hidden video, and ultimately discovering the true source behind the web of lies, a man that uses his privileged class position and wealth to intimidate and exploit others.", "It's a movie that starts off goofy and just becomes darker, more serious, and downright sad by the end, leaving you with the sinister impression of the danger of a powerful bully using Internet anonymity to satisfy his repressed kinks including emotional sadism.", "Tickled could be better as it feels disorganized and padded out, including an extended trip to another tickle fetish vendor.", "The ending leaves something to be desired as well and will send you online to scour for more information.", "Still, the story is naturally intriguing and the filmmakers don't mess up a good thing by allowing the curiosity to grab an audience.", "Nate's Grade: B", "Nate Z", "Super Reviewer", "Jun 30, 2016", "FUNNY BUSINESS - My Review of TICKLED (3 Stars)", "Sometimes jaw-dropping doesn't mean great.", "It may just mean that there are moments of surprise amidst a sea of questionable storytelling.", "Such is the case with TICKLED, the documentary by New Zealand filmmakers, David Farrier and Dylan Reeve, in which that moment of realization, the anagnorisis, feels stunning until you look back at how it was achieved....and then you may just feel slightly dirty.", "Let's rewind for a sec.", "Farrier and Reeve, an entertainment journalist and editor respectively, teamed up when they both stumbled upon Competitive Endurance Tickling videos online.", "After blogging about it online, their first inquiries resulted in threatening, homophobic (Farrier is gay) responses from a woman claiming to represent the producing company.", "Being good reporters, this only made the men more curious to delve deeper.", "What they uncovered proved far more nefarious than what they initially expected.", "In the tradition of host-driven documentaries like those of Michael Moore and Nick Broomfield, Farrier and Reeve insert themselves into and basically become part of the story.", "I won't spoil their discoveries, but the film seems on track to explore the perils of online coercion, identity theft and blackmail.", "Unfortunately, I took issue with the filmmakers' ambush tactics to get their story.", "Much as Michael Moore ambushed Dick Clark and Charlton Heston to get interviews with them, Farrier and Reeve use hidden cameras, secret voice recordings, or just showing up with cameras rolling to surprise their disapproving targets.", "We also witness some 11th hour sleight of hand as they miraculously uncover key evidence and subsequently get some PSYCHO-era dime-store psychology on one of the alleged perpetrators.", "It's all very haunting and, if true, speaks volumes on such issues as self-hatred, revenge, bullying, and how seemingly innocuous internet postings could ruin lives.", "The participants in these fetish videos are all young, Abercrombie & Fitch type models.", "They're mostly clothed, and despite the obvious homoeroticism, nothing overtly sexual occurs.", "How much the models knew about the videos actual usage remains somewhat of a mystery since only one model comes forward for an interview.", "In fact, some of the parties involved have attempted to discredit and/or seek legal action against the filmmakers, denying the allegations, claiming the subjects signed releases and had full knowledge of the company's intentions, and calling foul on the filmmakers' less-than-ethical tactics.", "The veracity of this documentary remains to be proven with both sides standing firm on their convictions.", "Regardless, TICKLED suffers from storytelling and filmmaking issues.", "A detour to another Tickling Video producer feels like filler as it doesn't seem to have any bearing on the main subject.", "Sure, it provides exposition we wouldn't have been able to get except in a voiceover, and the tickling demonstration we witness goes a long way in showing the fun side to this activity, but it feels like it's padding a slightly thin story.", "Also, the filmmakers in one moment use SURVIVOR-style symbolism of a bird of prey snatching away a squirrel, which elicited an audible groan from this viewer.", "I also felt empathy for the subjects when they were filmed without their permission, regardless of what crimes they may or may not be committing.", "On the plus side, Farrier and Reeve don't play to the cameras in the way Moore and Broomfield do.", "They're rather benign and quite kind to their subjects, never appearing to showboat to make a point.", "Because of that, I liked them but didn't necessarily like their methodology.", "It's kind of like tickling itself, it's hugely enjoyable/torturous in the moment, but when it's over, you don't feel anything anymore.", "You're left haunted, slightly traumatized, and yet unwilling to experience it again.", "Glenn G", "Super Reviewer", "See all Audience reviews", "## Tickled Quotes", "There are no approved quotes yet for this movie.", "## News & Features", "150 Erotic Movies",

due to cast their vote on a controversial and fundamental change to the organ donation system in Wales.", "The Welsh government is hoping to adopt a system of presumed consent for donating organs after death.", "The opt-out system, which could be introduced in 2015, would mean everyone is regarded as a willing donor when they die unless they state otherwise.", "Assembly members are due to cast their vote on whether to pass the Human Transplantation Bill.", "If the Bill is passed, regulations will still need to be approved before it becomes law following Royal Assent.", "## How will the system change?", "At the moment, people must sign the NHS Organ Donor Register or their families must agree before their organs can be used after their death.", "Under the new system, there will be two forms of consent in law - deemed consent, by those people who have not registered to opt-out of donating an organ, and express consent, by those who have registered to say they wish to be a donor.", "A single register will record whether or not someone wants to be an organ donor.", "Donors will also be able to record any wish to donate certain organs but not others.", "## Is it as simple as that?", "Not quite.", "There has been much debate about the role of families in the immensely difficult circumstances in which medical staff are talking to them about what should happen to their loved one's organs.", "Health Minister Mark Drakeford recently announced changes to give families a \"clear right of objection\".", "He has also said that organs will not be taken unless a family member is present.", "## Does that mean family members can veto an assumption that organs can be used?", "The relatives, or \"friends of long standing\", can object if they know that the deceased would not have consented.", "Medical staff would then use their judgement, based on the information provided, to decide whether or not to proceed with using the organs.", "The information must be \"sufficient to lead a reasonable person to conclude that they knew the deceased would not have consented\".", "## What if family members still object, but cannot provide such information?", "In law, the deceased consent will be deemed if that person has not opted out of being a donor.", "In practice, however, clinicians also have a duty not to add to the distress of relatives.", "Should there be no information indicating the deceased wanted to donate their organs, it is extremely unlikely that medical teams would remove organs against the clear wishes of family members.", "The family does not, however, have a legal veto.", "## Does it apply to tourists and university students?", "They will need to have been \"ordinarily resident\" in Wales for at least 12 months before their death.", "## Who else will the deemed consent principle not apply to?", "Anyone under the age of 18, someone from Wales who dies in another part of the United Kingdom and individuals who are not thought to have the mental capacity to make a decision on whether or not to be an organ donor.", "## How many people stand to benefit?", "It's a very small amount.", "Evidence from other countries with an opt-out system indicates that around 15 additional donors could be provided each year, and approximately 45 extra organs.", "It is estimated there are around 250 people on a waiting list for a transplant at any one time, 33 people in Wales died in 2012/13 whilst waiting.", "Welsh ministers believe the new system will save more lives and improve people's quality of life.", "The Welsh government also says the NHS will save money on expensive treatment such as kidney dialysis which can then be spent on services for patients.", "## What organs are involved?", "The same as with the current system.", "They include organs and tissues such as kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, pancreas, the small bowel, skin, bone, tendons and cartilage.", "## Will the organs only be used in Wales?", "No, organs donated in Wales may go anywhere in the UK and vice-versa, as is the case now.", "## When is the new system due to start?", "From 2015, to allow time for a major public information

The finds have enabled palaeontologists to reconstruct the lifestyles of the occupants and their environment in considerable detail. \n The finds in Gorham's Cave include charcoal, bones, stone tools and burnt seeds dating from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic periods, while Vanguard Cave contains Pleistocene and Middle Palaeolithic deposits. When Ibex Cave was discovered in 1975, fifty artifacts from the Middle Pleistocene period were found on the surface along with vertebrate remains and shells. Neanderthal tools were found in an excavation carried out there in 1994 by the Gibraltar Caves Project, though occupation of the cave seems to have been sporadic. Most of the stone tools appear to have been deposited during a single period of occupation, perhaps as short as a single day. \n "}}

On 3 August 2015, Norwich announced that Mulumbu suffered a broken metatarsal in a friendly against Brentford which would require surgery and sideline him for several weeks, ruling him out of the start of the season. He would finally make his debut on 27 October in a Capital One Cup game against Everton, which Norwich lost on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw. He made his Premier League debut a few days later on 31 October in a 2\u20131 defeat to Manchester City . However, with Jonny Howson, Alexander Tettey and Graham Dorrans preferred in the centre of midfield, Mulumbu would ultimately be confined to only five league starts and two appearances as a substitute in the 2015\u201316 season, plus one appearance in the FA Cup, and the season would end with Norwich relegated back to the Championship. \n Mulumbu remained with Norwich for the 2016\u201317 season but again found his opportunities for first team action restricted.

Huawei for network security incompetence \u2013 TechCrunch", "(meta data) AUTHOR: Natasha Lomas", "(meta data) PUBLISHER: https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "# UK report blasts Huawei for network security incompetence", "Natasha Lomas", "5 months", "The latest report by a UK oversight body set up to evaluation Chinese networking giant Huawei's approach to security has dialled up pressure on the company, giving a damning assessment of what it describes as \"serious and systematic defects\" in its software engineering and cyber security competence.", "Although the report falls short of calling for an outright ban on Huawei equipment in domestic networks \u2014 an option U.S. president Trump continues dangling across the pond.", "The report, prepared for the National Security Advisor of the UK by the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) Oversight Board, also identifies new \"significant technical issues\" which it says lead to new risks for UK telecommunications networks using Huawei kit.", "The HCSEC was set up by Huawei in 2010, under what the oversight board couches as \"a set of arrangements with the UK government\", to provide information to state agencies on its products and strategies in order that security risks could be evaluated.", "And last year, under pressure from UK security agencies concerned about technical deficiencies in its products, Huawei pledged to spend $2BN to try to address long-running concerns about its products in the country.", "But the report throws doubt on its ability to address UK concerns \u2014 with the board writing that it has \"not yet seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei's capacity to successfully complete the elements of its transformation programme that it has proposed as a means of addressing these underlying defects\".", "So it sounds like $2BN isn't going to be nearly enough to fix Huawei's security problem in just one European country.", "The board also writes that it will require \"sustained evidence\" of better software engineering and cyber security \"quality\", verified by HCSEC and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), if there's to be any possibility of it reaching a different assessment of the company's ability to reboot its security credentials.", "While another damning assessment contained in the report is that Huawei has made \"no material progress\" on issues raised by last year's report.", "All the issues identified by the security evaluation process relate to \"basic engineering competence and cyber security hygiene\", which the board notes gives rise to vulnerabilities capable of being exploited by \"a range of actors\".", "It adds that the NCSC does not believe the defects found are a result of Chinese state interference.", "This year's report is the fifth the oversight board has produced since it was established in 2014, and it comes at a time of acute scrutiny for Huawei, as 5G network rollouts are ramping up globally \u2014 pushing governments to address head on suspicions attached to the Chinese giant and consider whether to trust it with critical next-gen infrastructure.", "\"The Oversight Board advises that it will be difficult to appropriately risk-manage future products in the context of UK deployments, until the underlying defects in Huawei's software engineering and cyber security processes are remediated,\" the report warns in one of several key conclusions that make very uncomfortable reading for Huawei.", "\"Overall, the Oversight Board can only provide limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long-term,\" it adds in summary.", "Reached for its response to the report, a Huawei UK spokesperson sent us a statement in which it describes the $2BN earmarked for security improvements related to UK products as an \"initial budget\".", "It writes:", "The 2019 OB [oversight board] report details some concerns about Huawei's software engineering capabilities.", "We understand these concerns and take them very seriously.", "The issues identified in the OB report provide vital input for the ongoing transformation of our software engineering capabilities.", "In November last year Huawei's Board of Directors issued a resolution to carry out a companywide transformation programme aimed at enhancing our software engineering capabilities, with an initial budget of US$2BN.", "A high-level plan for the programme has been developed and we will continue to work with UK operators and the NCSC during its implementation to meet the requirements created as cloud, digitization, and software-defined everything become more prevalent.", "To ensure the ongoing security of global telecom networks, the industry, regulators, and governments need to work together on higher common standards for cyber security assurance and evaluation.", "Seeking to find something positive to salvage from the report's savaging, Huawei suggests it demonstrates the continued effectiveness of the HCSEC as a structure to evaluate and mitigate security risk \u2014 flagging a description where the board writes that it's \"arguably the toughest and most rigorous in the world\", and which Huawei claims shows at least there hasn't been any increase in vulnerability of UK networks since the last report.", "Though the report does identify new issues that open up fresh problems \u2014 albeit the underlying issues were presumably there last year too, just laying undiscovered.", "The board's withering assessment certainly amps up the pressure on Huawei which has been aggressively battling U.S.-led suspicion of its kit \u2014 claiming in a telecoms conference speech last month that \"the U.S. security accusation of our 5G has no evidence\", for instance.", "At the same time it has been appealing for the industry to work together to come up with collective processes for evaluating the security and trustworthiness of network kit.", "And earlier this month it opened another cyber security transparency center \u2014 this time at the heart of Europe in Brussels, where the company has been lobbying policymakers to help establish security standards to foster collective trust.", "Though there's little doubt that's a long game.", "Meanwhile, critics of Huawei can now point to impatience rising in the U.K., despite comments by the head of the NCSC, Ciaran Martin, last month \u2014 who said then that security agencies believe the risk of using Huawei kit can be managed, suggesting the government won't push for an outright ban.", "The report does not literally overturn that view but it does blast out a very loud and alarming warning about the difficulty for UK operators to \"appropriately\" risk-manage what's branded defective and vulnerable Huawei kit.", "Including flagging the risk of future products \u2014 which the board suggests will be increasingly complex to manage.", "All of which could well just push operators to seek alternatives.", "On the mitigation front, the board writes that \u2014 \"in extremis\" \u2014 the NCSC could order Huawei to carry out specific fixes for equipment currently installed in the UK.", "Though it also warns that such a step would be difficult, and could for example require hardware replacement which may not mesh with operators \"natural\" asset management and upgrades cycles, emphasizing it does not offer a sustainable solution to the underlying technical issues.", "\"Given both the shortfalls in good software engineering and cyber security practice and the currently unknown trajectory of Huawei's R&D processes through their announced transformation plan, it is highly likely that security risk management of products that are new to the UK or new major releases of software for products currently in the UK will be more difficult,\" the board writes in a concluding section discussing the UK national security risk.", "\"On the basis of the work already carried out by HCSEC, the NCSC considers it highly likely that there would be new software engineering and cyber security issues in products HCSEC has not yet examined.\"", "It also describes the number and severity of vulnerabilities plus architectural and build issues discovered by a relatively small team in the HCSEC as \"a particular concern\".", "\"If an attacker has knowledge of these vulnerabilities and sufficient access to exploit them, they may be able to affect the operation of the network, in some cases causing it to cease operating correctly,\" it warns.", "\"Other impacts could include being able to access user traffic or reconfiguration of the network elements.\"", "In another section on mitigating risks of using Huawei kit, the board notes that \"architectural controls\" in place in most UK operators can limit the ability of attackers to exploit any vulnerable network elements not explicitly exposed to the public Internet \u2014 adding that such controls, combined with good opsec generally, will \"remain critically important in the coming years to manage the residual risks caused by the engineering defects identified\".", "In other highlights from the report the board does have some positive things to say, writing that an NCSC technical review of its capabilities showed improvements in 2018, while another independent audit of HCSEC's ability to operate independently of Huawei HQ once again found \"no high or medium priority findings\".", "\"The audit report identified one low-rated finding, relating to delivery of information and equipment within agreed Service Level Agreements.", "Ernst & Young concluded that there were no major concerns and the Oversight Board is satisfied that HCSEC is operating in line with the 2010 arrangements between HMG and the company,\" it further notes.", "Last month the European Commissioner said it was preparing to step in to ensure a \"common approach\" across the European Union where 5G network security is concerned \u2014 warning of the risk of fragmentation across the single market.", "Though it has so far steered clear of any bans.", "Earlier this week it issued a set of recommendations for Member States, combining legislative and policy measures to assess 5G network security risks and help strengthen preventive measures.", "Among the operational measures it suggests Member States take is to complete a national risk assessment of 5G network infrastructures by the end of June 2019, and follow that by updating existing security requirements for network providers \u2014 including conditions for ensuring the security of public networks.", "\"These measures should include reinforced obligations on suppliers and operators to ensure the security of the networks,\" it recommends.", "\"The national risk assessments and measures should consider various risk factors, such as technical risks and risks linked to the behaviour of suppliers or operators, including those from third countries.", "National risk assessments will be a central element towards building a coordinated EU risk assessment.\"", "At an EU level the Commission said Member States should share information on network security, saying this \"coordinated work should support Member States' actions at national level and provide guidance to the Commission for possible further steps at EU level\" \u2014 leaving the door open for further action.", "While the EU's executive body has not pushed for a pan-EU ban on any 5G vendors it did restate Member States' right to exclude companies from their markets for national security reasons if they fail to comply with their own standards and legal framework."], "meta": {"id": "train05018-0",

Huawei replied that they were investigating the claims. \n In January 2019, Huawei patched a security flaw that was discovered by Microsoft in the \"PCManager\" software bundled on its laptops, after detecting that the software used a driver with behavior similar to the DoublePulsar exploit.

Each episode was directed by Atul Malhotra, whose previous directing work had included the 2002 series of \"Comedy Lab\". \n During promotion of the programme, considerable media attention was given to a record shown in the first episode of a man being licked on the buttocks by a dog as many times as possible in two minutes. Several commentators criticised the series as a whole for including such a segment: Jason Deans of \"The Guardian\" branded the show a \"dog's dinner\", while Jim Kresse of \"The Spokesman-Review\" stated that TV had \"officially hit bottom\" as a result. The record was set during episode one by Doug Bennett and his dog Harley with a final score of 71, before being broken during the third episode by Martin Shaw and his dog Star with a total of 145 licks. Executive producer Phil Gilheany defended the programme, describing it as \"quite innocent fun\". \n \"The People's Book of Records\" received a sponsorship deal from Kenco Rappor, and its first five episodes were broadcast during a prime time period on Channel 4 at 9:30\u00a0p.m. on Friday nights.

The performance remained Kudrow's only documented post-\"Friends\" \"Smelly Cat\" performance for several years. \n In 2014, singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat sang an a capella version of \"Smelly Cat\" live at a Central Perk-themed pop-up caf\u00e9 in Manhattan, New York, which had been launched to commemorate the show's 20th anniversary. Caillat's unscheduled performanced surprised many fans in attendance, who she encouraged to sing along. Despite praising Caillat's rendition as \"awesome\" for \"fulfill[ing] every \"Friends\" fanatic's fantasy\", \"Bustle\"'s Aly Semigran criticized her for performing only half of the song. However, she believes her rendition should lead to a Phoebe tribute album, on which she should reprise \"Smelly Cat\". At the same pop-up, actor James Michael Tyler, who portrayed Central Perk barista Gunther, performed the first verse of the song with band The Rembrandts, who originally recorded \"I'll Be There for You\". Brent Furdyk of \"Entertainment Tonight Canada\" described the Tyler-Rembrandts rendition as \"Jim Morrison-esque\".

Players are given 2 near-identical pictures and must uncover differences between the two images under a time limit by using the pointer of the Wii Remote. The player controls 2 cursors: one for precision zooming in, and the other for selecting part of an image. The game supports up to 4 players in Party Mode, where the aim of the game is to spot the most differences amongst players, a \"Find The Monkey\" mode, which involves finding a picture of a monkey hidden in a photo. The monkeys vary in art style and appearance. Another \"Super Fun Classic\", which entails finding 5 differences in similar looking pictures within a specific amount of time. After the mode ends, the player's score is imputed on a scoreboard, which is accessible from the main menu. The final game mode, \"Leisure\", has no time limit and has the player attempting to progress through 5 photos as quick as possible. The game features 333 pictures."}}

Quito, Ecuador, was named to replace Santiago, but it also withdrew, in late 1984.  Desperate, PASO held a new election. Indianapolis was planning to bid on the 1991 Games, but, at the request of the United States Olympic Committee, submitted a bid for 1987. Since many sports facilities were already in place, PASO announced on December 18, 1984, that Indianapolis would be the host. Havana, Cuba, was interested. PASO appeased Fidel Castro. Fidel Castro had threatened to boycot the games."}}

14, 2018, TBA (Android) MSRP: $2.99", "I feel there are two things I should make clear from the outset: I can't give my honest opinion about this game without spoiling nearly everything about it -- so you've been warned -- and, despite Destructoid being primarily a video game website, Florence isn't really a game.", "Developer Mountains even says so when it refers to it as a 'story' upon completion.", "Sure, there are micro- and mini-game-like elements in it I use to advance the narrative, but it's not a game.", "It's an interactive sonnet, a poem, a poesy about people in love, art, artists and the muses that drive us to create.", "The titular Florence, full name Florence Yeoh, is as relatable a protagonist as I've found in the medium.", "She's a 25-year-old worker bee at an unnamed company who spends her morning commutes browsing pictures on her smartphone and her evenings eating in front of the television.", "I'm there to push her through this routine.", "Everything from brushing her teeth to punching numbers into spreadsheets are simple, touchscreen tasks.", "These actions aren't meant to challenge me, only to add a level of interactivity to her life.", "The micro-games, if you'd even call them that, are substitutes for a traditional narrative.", "Florence has little to no dialog with the only written words found in chapter and location identifiers, as well as in brief conversations with Florence's doting mother.", "Instead, the 40-minute-or-so story uses expressions, visual cues, and these touchscreen elements to detail this exquisite slice of Florence's life.", "Honestly, I can't recall a more imaginative presentation of pure storytelling than this.", "Florence unravels with a mix of comic-book style still imagery and quaint animation.", "It's incredibly effective.", "As I drag my finger across the screen, I see stunning snippets of Florence's life play out with the occasional bit of input required from me.", "This is a truly beautiful product, with an amazing score by Kevin Penkin, but the developers don't want me to dwell on any one moment for too long.", "No matter how much the ageless art direction captivates me, Florence pushes me onward with subtle cues that beckon me to progress.", "There's no way to turn these off and I wish there was because, knowing how things turn out, a part of me wants to live in the more joyful moments of Florence's life for as long as I can.", "But that goes against the point of this story as is made crystal clear in the jaw-droppingly melancholic Chapter 18.", "Living in the past holds us back.", "Continually analyzing what could have been means we might miss out on life's calling and that's true for Florence.", "She's more than just a 9-to-5 pencil pusher.", "Like me, like all of us, she has dreams.", "A quick jaunt to the days of her youth reveals a love for art stifled by a mother who'd rather see her daughter study.", "Like any creator stuck in a career that provides no motivation for weekend explorations of our talent, Florence doesn't pursue her passion until she meets her muse.", "Looking like a character from a Diablo Cody movie by way of Quentin Blake, Krish is a charming cellist whose music literally sweeps Florence off her feet.", "After a meet-cute, the two begin a relationship and the magic of Florence's interactivity begins to shine, perhaps no greater than when Flo and Krish have a conversation.", "The start of a relationship, the first date, is a tricky ordeal as two people struggle to find a comfort level with one another.", "Florence presents these introductory conversations as puzzles, and as the two grow closer together, the puzzles become easier to piece together until there is no assembly required.", "It's a magnificent way to show how familiar the couple becomes with one another and, along with such concepts as the passage of time or making room for someone in your life, how simple mechanics can illustrate thoughts and emotions eloquently without the need for dialog.", "Emojis also help.", "Florence and Krish's relationship isn't just young love but young artists in love.", "Krish's life, at least the parts of it I'm shown, is wrapped in the pursuit of his art.", "He dreams of filling auditoriums with his music and worldwide fame, and it's his expressive detailing of these fantasies that reignites Florence's interest in her art.", "As time marches on and they survive their first fight, she finds inspiration in him and he finds support in her.", "Together, they create wonderful art: him with a cello and her with a sketchpad.", "But art is a selfish pursuit.", "If there is any lesson I learned from the 90,000 allegories shoved into mother!", "it's that.", "Despite the admiration we show our muses, there eventually comes a time when we no longer need them or their inspiration ceases to have an effect on us.", "As their romance develops, Florence and Krish's artistic pursuits fail to coexist.", "Eventually, it is his goals and dreams that become their joint focus.", "As her passion once again fades into the background of a monotonous life, the demands of his music begin to crack the foundation of their relationship.", "For lovers of love, Florence doesn't have a happy ending.", "No matter how cute they look together, she and Krish eventually drift apart and go their separate ways.", "It's a bit too heavy-handed at first, pulling in some clich\u00e9s from the genre to present despondent emotions, but it absolutely crushes me when it's time for her to actually let go.", "As her story continues through this post-Krish era, I wonder what Florence is trying to tell me about love.", "I've seen enough romantic comedies and episodes of Sex and the City to know that love is messy.", "I've watched my friends cycle through the emotional merry-go-round in their search for a partner as I spent my prime getting fat and playing video games.", "Making a relationship work is a struggle, from what I can surmise, and Florence doesn't hold back.", "It's upsetting to watch this bond deteriorate and see her move on afterward, but as Florence finally reaches her full potential, I'm left unsatisfied.", "I understand how life can get in the way and how easy it can be to put your wants aside for the sake of those you love.", "But as Florence jumps through the relationship and finds an enemy in monotony, I almost feel robbed of her struggles.", "The game does a great job of showing me how her responsibilities supersede creative pursuits, but when she finally finds the time to engage her talents, it all comes too easy for her.", "I watched for several chapters as Krish struggled with the demands of his musical education and the effect it had on their relationship.", "It was something I could relate to outside of the whole having a relationship thing.", "But seeing Florence sashay into stardom with no setbacks, stop signs, or stumbles takes this honest depiction of artistic struggle and wraps it up a little too nicely.", "It's like La La Land in tha\u2014oh God this game is basically just La La Land.", "Florence is an imaginative, breathtaking, heartbreaking tale of two artists trying a love they're not quite ready for.", "It's as honest a look at the subject matter as you'll find in a game -- or so I've been told by others who've been writing about it incessantly since its release.", "But as much as Florence focuses on love, I'm not quite sure it's a fan of it.", "Perhaps it's because it doesn't play out as I'd hope or maybe I'm too broken to appreciate its beauty, but I walk away from the experience with a rather pessimistic opinion.", "Love may be the catalyst in Florence, but it's the narcissistic pursuit of their real passion, art, that wins out in the end.", "The result is a relationship that is a means to an end, nothing more.", "I get that's quite the bleak take on the tale, but honestly, it's the

He was stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, before being deployed on Operation Desert Storm. \n Speaking of his experience in Kuwait in an interview before his execution, documented in McVeigh's authorized biography \"American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh & the Tragedy at Oklahoma City\", he stated he decapitated an Iraqi soldier with cannon fire on his first day in the war and celebrated. He said he was later shocked to be ordered to execute surrendering prisoners and to see carnage on the road leaving Kuwait City after U.S. troops routed the Iraqi army. McVeigh received several service awards, including the Bronze Star Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the Kuwaiti Liberation Medal. McVeigh aspired to join the United States Army Special Forces (SF).

Compton's science-fiction work The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe.", "The book chronicles the dystopian adventures of a woman who's told she has four weeks to live in a world where death from incurable diseases has been virtually eliminated.", "Compton builds an intricately imagined and believable near future not so different from our own, complete with wildly popular reality shows that feed the appetite of a public described as \"pain-starved.\"", "The story is told in chapters that alternate between Katherine's point of view and the first-person account of Roddie, the host of one such TV program, Human Destiny.", "As soon as Katherine receives her diagnosis, Roddie is on the hunt, his production company tasked with getting her to agree to become the 24-7 subject of a voyeuristic reality show.", "From the first time Roddie, incognito, meets Katherine in the church where she's hidden to escape the repercussions of having signed away her rights to privacy, Compton asks questions about trust, betrayal, and public versus private selves with unexpected nuance and humanity.", "Roddie may be the \"bad guy\" here, but he grows to respect Katherine while also being just as in thrall to a dysfunctional society.", "At its heart, however, Compton's book is about two essential predicaments of the human condition: mortality and love.", "Harkening back to social realist novels by the likes of Theodore Dreiser, Compton's structure methodically but brilliantly exposes Katherine to different strata of society as she reckons with her diagnosis and Roddie reckons with the man his job has made him.", "Compton offers not only a wise story and a chilling appraisal of society that still rings true, but also an indelible portrait of an intelligent, middle-aged woman grappling with the ultimate existential crisis: How should one conduct oneself while dying?", "Published in 1974 during an era of political and social upheaval, a quiet novel like The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe might have looked, at the time, out of step, or insufficiently radical.", "The Cold War had turned hot in Vietnam, college campuses from the United States to France were seeing a series of activist-sparked uprisings that transformed or failed to transform society, and terrorist groups like Baader-Meinhof took the bluntest approach to dissent.", "It was an anxious time\u2014people worried about the environment, racism, the status of women.", "New technologies that seemingly transformed everyday life were introduced: In 1971, the CAT scan was field-tested; in 1974, supermarkets began to use bar codes; in 1975, the first home computers made an appearance.", "Katherine Mortenhoe appeared during a fertile period of speculative production.", "Early 1970s movies included Solaris, Slaughterhouse-Five, Silent Running, Soylent Green, A Clockwork Orange, and The Andromeda Strain.", "Among the novels of the day were Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, and the first English translation of Boris and Arkady Strugatsky's Hard to Be a God, while important work by Philip K. Dick, Joe Haldeman, and Ursula K. Le Guin followed not long after.", "Only a few years later, Hollywood blockbusters like Jaws and Star Wars would commodify not just the film industry but also, eventually, parts of the market for science-fiction novels as well.", "Most of Compton's speculative peers were looking outward in their work, toward alien encounters or stories that played out across vast vistas of time and space\u2014and most of the counterculture media would have seemed more revolutionary.", "A Clockwork Orange, for example, contains scenes that on first glance are similar to those in Katherine Mortenhoe in how they comment on society, though they're more direct and flamboyant and, perhaps, cruel.", "Yet Katherine Mortenhoe remains as relevant today as more obvious classics from the 1970s.", "This is largely because the novel stands apart from its times, but it is also because it displays an astonishingly easy intimacy and interiority.", "These are the hardest effects for a novelist to achieve, and all too often novels that critique media take on a metallic patina, a shell-like hardness as a result of this lack of fluidity.", "Katherine Mortenhoe isn't a symbol set in silhouette against the klieg lights of a dysfunctional society: She's a living, breathing person.", "Her gift for sussing out the emotional states and motivations of those close to her as she nears death\u2014what they're really saying, what they really want\u2014is both remarkable and ordinary.", "What's ordinary is that most people have this ability to read those around them.", "What's remarkable is Compton's ability to describe it.", "His psychological acuity is one of several elements that sets his book apart from cultural artifacts that do no more than evoke nostalgia for received ideas of a mod-era England.", "In Katherine Mortenhoe this tendency appears briefly only once or twice\u2014especially in a scene involving rich swingers, and even here Compton wisely subverts the hackneyed idea of a '70s drug orgy.", "Instead of indulging in the excess, or giving any of it a sensual sheen, there's a sad lack of intimacy and vagueness that suggests actors going through the motions.", "Katherine's mortality, revealed in the midst of what is meant to be hedonistic revelry, isn't so much a buzz-kill as it is the blossoming of a truth that makes all the rest seem fake.", "Physical evidence of her sickness has a similar effect on waylaying bikers in another set piece.", "Confronted with the real real, the fake real\u2014the constructions by which groups or individuals enact ritual to get what they want, or even to try to forget the simple, basic truth that everybody dies\u2014is torn apart or rendered inert, without agency.", "Interiority and intimacy push back against nostalgia by placing the reader always in the present, continuous moment.", "By grounding the story in the human dimension, these qualities open a space for the themes of the novel that are directly concerned with the superhuman, with media and machine.", "Roddie, who as we learn early on has been implanted with a camera that records all he sees, is \"the man with the TV eyes.\"", "He and his boss Vincent are the 1970s equivalent of today's most parasitical reality show creators and hosts.", "Their world is an uncanny mirror of our own, of an age in which everyone really is a camera eye, or at least carries one around in his pocket.", "And just like today, the communication is two-way for Roddie.", "Things come through the screen in our modern life all the time now and infect us.", "We let the pixels that gather to form images or words affect us mentally and physically\u2014we let that happen, we in many cases wish for it happen.", "We, in a sense, allow a kind of hypnosis to occur, by which we are then transformed, not always in positive ways.", "Compton suggests that those closest to the epicenter of the ubiquitous image-making, people like Roddie and Vincent who manufacture it and benefit from it, are those who suffer its greatest deformation: \"The state of communion withered.", "The bones beneath these people's faces were just as true, and the heroism just as possible, but the people themselves were recently constructed, totally alien.", "They were NTV [network] people.\"", "In an age in which privacy isn't just vanishing but willfully renounced, The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe seems not only relevant but proactively current.", "Katherine's motivations and reactions and thoughts about her world are familiar but not trite.", "They include the questions we are only beginning to puzzle out: What should I share?", "What is my private self apart from my public self?", "How do I get off the grid?", "How does what I share affect those around me?", "Why do I feel like part of me has to die for another part of me to be revealed?", "And while the book is set before the existence of an ever-flowing social-media stream, it depicts a society in which it's possible to become media: Roddie is literally transformed into a recording and broadcasting device.", "The book forecasts a world in which people crave virtual emotion; they have to feel feelings much like vampires have to drink blood.", "The great trap awaiting novelists who embark on a critique of media\u2014new or old\u2014is one Baudrillard might have recognized as the pop-culture consumerist hegemony.", "The observer becomes devoured by the thing being observed and the results are so broad, lurid, salacious, and in all ways colonized by the corruptor that object or character and backdrop merge.", "Compton's terrible insight, into both Katherine's interior world and\u2014through an account that amounts to a confession\u2014into Roddie's view of events, shows us that interiority can trump the voyeuristic tendencies of the camera, the coarsening that would have otherwise leached away the private, the personal.", "Few fictions, in theory, date faster than novels that grapple with media, except perhaps films on the subject.", "Furthermore, of late it's become clear that novels incorporating the very latest media\u2014text messages, Facebook comment threads\u2014tend to be compromised by such inclusions. The surrounding text seems poor in texture, devoid of richness.", "Perhaps this is because, as John Durham Peters writes in The Marvelous Clouds, \"We live in a palimpsest of new and old.", "Despite occasional prophecies of decline, the most fundamental media are still with us.\"", "But perhaps instead, as he further notes, media is still learning not to be afraid to die, and that detachment, not documentation, is key.", "If nothing degrades or evolves faster than media, then nothing can seem less epic in scope than the intimate details of an individual's death\u2014especially the death of a citizen who isn't a great civic leader or historical figure.", "But in this regard, too, Katherine Mortenhoe seems even more important today than when it was published.", "In a very real sense, the progress of Katherine's deterioration, the societal denial of death itself carries the novel forward into the modern era.", "Big themes, like love and death, are what we say we value in our best literature.", "But in fact, the best novels about love or death often go unappreciated; they make us too uncomfortable.", "Great writers, like D. G. Compton, understand, too, that the unfolding reality of an important theme never exists at some portentous or weighty level; it can only come to life within the deft, nimble specific details of character and setting.", "Perhaps the greatest testimonial to The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe and the power of an interior life is its strength in comparison to the 1980 film version, Death Watch.", "An earnest attempt, the film hasn't dated well in some ways and can never match the intimate interiority of the text.", "You could argue this falls to the choice of director and cast, or something in the script, but I think that in writing a commentary on our relationship to media, the public world, and the dangers and limitations of an ever-watchful recording eye, Compton hasn't just written a masterpiece.", "He's also written something that is, ironically enough, deeply and forever unfilmable.", "There will always be an inner world that no one can see and that cannot be expressed except through the medium of words.", "This article has been adapted from the introduction to D.G. Compton's reissued book, The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe.", "We want to hear what you think about this article.", "Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.", "Jeff VanderMeer's latest novel is Borne.", "He is also the author of Annihilation, Authority, and Acceptance (the Southern Reach Trilogy)."], "meta": {"id": "train34177-1", "claim_title": "David G.

In March 1999, NATO launched a massive air-bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in response to the Yugoslav Army's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo. \n In the last six months of the Clinton administration, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that the term \"rogue state\" would be abolished in June 2000, in favour of the term \"states of concern\", as three of the nations listed as \"rogue states\" (Libya, Iran, and North Korea) no longer met the conditions established to define a \"rogue state\". \n Libya was removed from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list in 2006 after achieving success through diplomacy. Relations with Libya also became more mutual following the eight month Libyan Civil War in 2011, which resulted in the National Transitional Council ousting longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from power. In 2015, the US reopened its embassy in Cuba."}}

Ferrigno had previously appeared in the first season episode \"His Hero\", and Perlman had previously appeared in the second season entry \"Mortal Recoil\". \n In the opening scene, Herpich used unicorn symbolism, most notably the tapestry \"The Unicorn is in Captivity and No Longer Dead\", a piece of the seven-part tapestry \"The Hunt of the Unicorn\", to illustrate the themes of the episode. According to then-character designer Andy Ristaino, the decision was conscientious, but that \"as for the meaning you're just going to have to think about unicorn symbology and how that relates to a specific character in the episode.\" Later, in the DVD commentary for the fourth season, Herpich revealed that the unicorn is representative of the Lich, because they both have one horn.

Kelley helped to greatly increase affiliations to the council. Many of the new affiliations were general unions of unskilled workers, a development which Kelley opposed as he felt the organisations would not endure, but they soon came to dominate the council. Despite this, Kelley remained the council's most prominent figure, being elected to Manchester City Council in 1891 as a Liberal-Labour representative. \n In 1902, the council convened a meeting of local trade unionists and members of the Independent Labour Party and Social Democratic Federation, which renamed the council as the Manchester Trades and Labour Council, becoming the local affiliate of the Labour Representation Committee.  Two years later, Kelley broke his links with the Liberals, and in 1906 he was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament, standing down from his trades council posts. \n In the 1920s, the council affiliated to the Communist Party of Great Britain-led National Minority Movement.  Although the Labour Party set up its own Manchester Borough organisation, the council continued to campaign on a wide range of labour issues, remaining the leading labour movement organisation in the city into the 1930s, and attracted the support of John Maynard Keynes for its proposals on local industrial policy.

data pricing strategy, but not so much -- the carrier is coming out swinging today with some significant changes that should benefit the overwhelming majority of its smartphone users (and could stand to harm a select few).", "Let's break down the major points:", "###### DataPlus / DataPro", "The existing $30 fair-use \"unlimited\" smartphone data plan is being replaced by two new options: $15 per month for 200MB and $25 for 2GB (called \"DataPlus\" and \"DataPro,\" respectively).", "Customers currently on the $30 plan are welcome to stay on it, but they can switch at any time without extending their contract.", "AT&T's new overage system is arguably the game changer: on the $15 plan, you'll pay $15 for each additional 200MB, but on the $25 plan, you'll pay $10 for each additional GB.", "It's simple and straightforward -- but most importantly, it won't bankrupt you if you go over by a gig or three in a month.", "This compares to $50 per gigabyte of overage on AT&T's 5GB DataConnect plan for laptops.", "The carrier's going to be very flexible about changing between the DataPlus and DataPro plans -- if you're on DataPlus, for example, and you discover that you're blowing past your allotment, you can choose either to start DataPro the following billing cycle, pro-rate it, or apply the higher plan retroactively to the beginning of your current billing cycle.", "That's pretty wild.", "###### Tethering", "Tethering will be offered as an add-on to the DataPro plan for an additional $20 per month, which means you'll pay a total of $45 a month for 2GB of data shared between your phone and your tethered devices.", "If you're light on the usage, it's a sweet deal -- but if you scale it up and you're using the data almost exclusively on your laptop, it compares unfavorably to the traditional DataConnect plan: $60 versus $75 for 5GB (and in the unlikely even you've got a webOS device on Verizon, it compares even less favorably).", "If you're striking a balance of data use between a smartphone and tethered gear, AT&T's new setup is still pretty solid considering that you would've been paying $60 for the USB stick plus $30 for smartphone data before.", "Yes, it's finally happening: AT&T's iPhones will get access to the tethering option, too.", "###### iPad", "iPad users are also affected by the change.", "The $30 iPad data plan -- lauded for being labeled by AT&T as truly unlimited -- goes away to be replaced by the same $25 / 2GB plan that smartphone users will see, though current subscribers to the $30 plan can continue unaffected.", "Everything launches on June 7, except for iPhone tethering -- it'll launch when OS 4 does.", "In the meantime, we're told users can sign up for the $30 plans both on their phones and iPads if they'd like to be grandfathered in.", "Follow the break for more details along with AT&T's full press release.", "We're definitely mourning the death of unlimited data -- \"unlimited\" is a word that consumers always naturally like to hear -- but AT&T points out that 98 percent of its smartphone subscribers use less than 2GB a month, which means that nearly all users ultimately stand to see a $5 reduction in their monthly bills.", "We spoke to Mark Collins -- AT&T Mobility's senior vice president of data and voice products -- about the changes for a few clarifications on the company's strategy, and he made it crystal clear that the concept of unlimited data is a thing in the past (echoing comments made recently by Verizon's Lowell McAdam), particularly in light of the oncoming spectrum crunch that stands to make wireless broadband an even more precious commodity than it already is.", "He also mentioned that laptop plans are unaffected by this move, though he went on to say that they've laid a \"framework\" for data pricing here that should continue all the way through to the company's LTE rollout, so we wouldn't be surprised to see some tweaks made on the laptop side sooner or later (to

It is a single-player campaign with a plot completely separate from that of the main campaign. The player assumes the role of Subject Sigma, another Alpha Series Big Daddy, as he travels through Minerva's Den, home to Rapture's Central Computing. The campaign adds three new levels and provides deeper insight into Rapture's inner workings. The add-on also features new weapons, a new plasmid, and new enemy types. The DLC was released on PC on May 31, 2011. With the closure of the Games for Windows \u2013 Live Marketplace, the PC version of \"BioShock 2\" was patched in October 2013 to remove Games for Windows Live in favor of Steamworks support for matchmaking. \"Minerva's Den\" was released for free for players who owned \"BioShock 2\" before the patch."}}

In 2009, Sheen departed from the group. Sheen departed to study abroad."}}

baptized in a river, grew up on a Depression-era farm, and moved to Smalltown, U.S.A., at the end of World War II.", "In 1947 she married a dashing Army Air Corps vet, bore him two sons, and spent the greater part of the next half-century working for a string of Smalltown accountants.", "Hers, I suppose, was a nominally uneventful existence, at least when judged by the short-sighted standards of the world.", "Yet Evelyn Teachout, who died peacefully last night after a long illness, loved her life and made a deep impression on everyone who met her, for she was a quick-witted, thoroughly decent person whose kindness and generosity were self-evident.", "Not surprisingly, I adored her, in part because she was good without being insipid.", "She could be blunt, but never cruel, and I never heard her speak a hurtful or thoughtless word, to me or anyone else.", "As I once wrote in this space, \"She showed me how to laugh, admired my achievements, brushed off my failures, assured me whenever necessary that pretty much anything I wanted to do in life would be fine with her, and never left me in the slightest doubt of her love\u2026.You can't get much luckier than that.\"", "Whenever she came to New York, I did my best to make each trip an adventure.", "It was in my company that she first saw a painting by Rembrandt and a ballet by George Balanchine.", "Her increasingly fragile health, alas, meant that these trips were few and far between, so I called her most nights from wherever I happened to be\u2013she liked it when I called her from a cab en route to a Broadway show\u2013and visited her in Smalltown two or three times a year.", "My guess is that she liked that much better than coming to see me, for she was never drawn to city life.", "She lived in the same house for a half-century, and the longer she lived there, the more she appreciated it.", "\"She draws strength from that house,\" my brother told me once.", "My mother outlived my father by fourteen years.", "During that time chronic pain (she suffered from debilitating back problems) reduced her to a shadow of the tough, vital woman who raised my brother and me.", "At length it became clear that her memory was going, too, and a neurologist confirmed what we feared most: dementia was setting in.", "But she responded immediately and strongly to medication, so much so that she was able to continue living at home, and she made no secret of her hope that she would die before that ceased to be possible.", "Would that it had been so, but she became grievously ill last summer, and three emergency operations forced her into a nursing home that she never again left for more than a few hours at a time.", "Fortunately, I was able to visit her more than once while she was still herself, taking the opportunity to tell her repeatedly what she already knew, which was that I loved her with all my heart.", "So, too, did Mrs. T, who came to know and cherish my mother late in her long life, and to admire the courage with which she faced the cruel illnesses that beset her.", "As for David and Kathy, my brother and sister-in-law, the selfless and uncomplaining devotion with which they cared for my mother in the last year of her life is more moving\u2013and inspiring\u2013than I can possibly say.", "They were wholly responsible for the grueling day-to-day task of making sure that she was as comfortable as she could possibly be.", "Because I live in Manhattan, I was unable to do much more than cheer them on at a distance, flying back to Smalltown as often as I could, which wasn't nearly often enough.", "Now they will live in the house where David and I grew up, for which I am profoundly grateful.", "My mother's last public appearance was at the wedding of Lauren Teachout Dukes, her granddaughter and my niece, in October of 2011.", "Though she needed all her fast-waning strength simply to be there, she left the ceremony knowing that she was greatly loved, not

They had raped an unconscious 21-year-old victim in the school's Gillette House dorm on June 23, 2013. The defendants were dismissed from the football team on June 29, 2013 and banned from campus during the six-week investigation that followed. A fifth player, Chris Boyd, pleaded guilty to criminal attempt to commit accessory after the fact and was dismissed from the team but not the university for his role in helping to cover up the rape. \n In July 2016, Batey received a 15-year prison sentence after being convicted. In November 2016, Vanderburg was sentenced to 17 years in prison after being convicted. In August 2017, Banks received a 15-year sentence after being convicted. "}}

recovered from the home. \n The Turpins were charged with twelve counts of torture, twelve counts of false imprisonment, seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult, and six counts of child abuse. David received an additional charge of a lewd act on a child under 14 years old. Upon announcing the charges against the Turpins, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said, \"The abuse and severe neglect intensified over time and intensified as they moved to California.\" The couple pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n In a brief hearing on January 24, the judge accepted the prosecutors' request for a restraining order forbidding contact between the Turpin parents and their children for a period of three years. The parents are prohibited from coming within 100 yards (91\u00a0m) of any of their children or establishing electronic contact with them. Both defendants agreed to these restrictions. On February 23, Hestrin filed an additional three charges of child abuse against the couple."}}

Cabot denied she had ever acted in such a manner and upon further investigation all charges against Cabot were dismissed and she still retains a gun permit. \n She garnered more notoriety in 2004 when Salem Police came to her home in order to remove her adolescent grandson over a custody issue between Jody Cabot and her former husband. Both incidents were covered by local and national press and even featured on CNN. A policeman claimed that during the incident Cabot ordered him to look into her eyes, telling him he was cursed once he did. Cabot denies she ever cursed the policeman, stating \"I say it is a curse when you do bad things.\" \n "}}

could be said that Elvis Costello had the distinct pleasure of living out the ultimate dream of every sharp-witted, incurably bitter young bastard with hopes of achieving stardom.", "In only two and a half years, he was propelled from an awkward, computer-programming teenager with a Jazzmaster and ugly glasses to the prototype for chic geekdom.", "Virtually overnight, he established himself as among the most articulate songwriters rock music has ever seen, infusing punk with the literacy it had always strived for but rarely achieved.", "With superstar status and a reputation for pushing the envelope, Costello was able to crystallize the thematic threads of political and personal devastation that ran through his first two records into the concept of \"emotional fascism,\" the original title for Armed Forces.", "Though Armed Forces is in many ways the most conceptually aggressive and confrontational of Costello's first three records, it doesn't carry with it the same immediacy of his first two releases, 1977's My Aim Is True and 1978's This Year's Model, on which he came as a man with something to prove.", "There's something intensely subversive about My Aim Is True with its undercurrents of anger and frustration providing a foundation for his synthesis of pop melody, country twang, and punk energy.", "This Year's Model, meanwhile, saw Costello expanding his sound significantly, with each instrument coming through as clear and urgent as a warning siren.", "It was equal parts whispered confession and frantic street corner sermon, and though he never quite reached its apex again, Armed Forces comes very close.", "As Costello writes in the liner notes to this expanded reissue, Armed Forces marks the first time that he was actually aware of his audience.", "Perhaps in an attempt to elucidate the web of veiled and convoluted social and personal references running through his first two records, the album is lyrically much more general, and remarkably self-conscious, right from the opening lyric, \"Oh, I just don't know where to begin.\"", "This, of course, doesn't slow Costello down-- \"Accidents Will Happen\", one of the finest songs in his, or any, repertoire, matches a signature smirking double-entendre with an almost Baroque pop sensibility.", "Melodically and lyrically, the song is above reproach, as Costello sings of infidelity with what could either be construed as regret or smug satisfaction.", "It's also one of several songs on Armed Forces to benefit from the album's dense production.", "Whereas both My Aim Is True and This Year's Model are sharply produced, relatively sparse affairs, Armed Forces is extravagantly layered with dense instrumentation and rich, effusive textures.", "Pete Thomas' maniacal drumming is much more consistent than on previous outings, and keyboardist Steve Nieve, for the first time, is as likely to be found at a piano as behind a synthesizer.", "On \"Accidents Will Happen\" and the similarly stunning \"Oliver's Army\", in which Costello winds catchy and elegant melodies around slightly off-kilter chord progressions, the production works to the record's advantage, filling the songs out with bombastic power-pop arrangements and giving weight to their urgency.", "\"Big Boys\" and \"Green Shirt\"-- two subdued products of the same mold that produced \"The Beat\" and \"Pump It Up\", and make full use of steady, insistent rhythms and the unstoppable kinetic energy of The Attractions-- are near-classics as well, but are somewhat hindered by the album's smoother production.", "An earlier acoustic version of \"Big Boys\" included as a bonus track on Rhino's reissue of This Year's Model reveals layers of anger and heartbreak that the album version buries beneath impenetrable four-part harmonies and a heavy fog of reverb.", "Of course, even if the production on Armed Forces often serves to conceal, rather than reveal the nuances of Costello's songwriting and The Attractions' always impeccable playing, the songwriting can hardly be argued with.", "\"Goon Squad\" carries on the menacing tone and complex rhythms of \"Watching the Detectives\" and \"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\" with a prodigious sense of melody; \"Party Girl\" is yet another example of Costello successfully executing what would, in the hands of a lesser musician, quickly strike as overwrought; \"Moods for Moderns\" turns disco clich\u00e9 into new wave brilliance; and a fiery, acidic cover of Nick Lowe's \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding\" mockingly closes an album packed with dauntless, condemnatory social commentary.", "In the end, the greatest strength of Armed Forces may be the same thing that makes it less viscerally powerful than Costello's two prior records-- its songs absolutely demand to be appreciated for their craftsmanship.", "In many ways, Armed Forces can be seen as the point at which Costello dropped the role of angry young upstart, and became more comfortable with his personification as a songwriter.", "And considering that he has since remained largely true to this sound, it can be seen not only as the consummation of all he had worked toward, but a window to what he would later accomplish."], "meta": {"id": "train40011-1", "claim_title": "Oliver's Army", "claim_section": "Critical reception.", "claim_context": "\"Oliver's Army\" has attracted positive reviews from music critics. In 1979, Geoffrey Himes of \"The Washington Post\" praised the \"compressed drama\" of \"Oliver's Army\", along with all the other tracks on \"Armed Forces\", and highlighted the song's lyrics, despite calling it \"almost a direct steal from Spector's hit with the Ronettes, 'Baby, I Love You'\". Maslin called the track the \"pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\" of \"Armed Forces\" and praised the contrast between the song's music and lyrics.

span 27 years, 6 in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly and 21 in the federal Parliament.", "Lloyd Axworthy entered federal politics in May 1979 as a Liberal MP, defeating former provincial Progressive

(1983-84).", "Following the Liberal defeat by the Progressive Conservatives in the 1984 election, Axworthy became Liberal critic for regional and industrial expansion, the Canadian Wheat Board (1984), trade (1985-90, a prominent critic of FREE TRADE in that role), and external affairs (1990-93).", "The latter position involved working closely with Central American lobby groups and rights

expressed \"sorrow, regret and apology\" for some mistakes he made in planning the conflict.", "The former prime minister called a press conference to respond to the report, starting with an emotional statement that he accepted \"full responsibility without exception or excuse\" for the consequences of the war.", "But, by the end, Blair had delivered a defiant justification of his reasons for taking the UK to war, and rejected most of the criticisms contained in the report, authored by Sir John Chilcot.", "He began by describing the choice to join the US in military action as the \"hardest, most momentous, most agonising decision\" of his life.", "Blair said he had wanted to set the Iraqi people free and secure them from the \"evil\" of Saddam Hussein, but instead they had become victims of sectarian violence.", "\"For all of this, I express more sorrow, regret and apology than you can ever know or believe,\" he said, in a speech in which his voice cracked with emotion.", "The Labour politician went on to repeat that he apologised for the failures in planning the war and its aftermath, but was clear that he still believes the decision to remove Saddam was correct.", "Iraq could be in a worse state than Syria is now if the regime had not been stopped, he suggested.", "\"I did it because I thought it was right,\" Blair said.", "Pressed on what he was apologising for, the former prime minister named three areas where he would have done things differently: presenting the cabinet with an \"option paper\"; pressing the US to have better planning in place for the aftermath; and sharing the advice of the attorney general to senior colleagues.", "Following the report, some MPs said they believe he lied to parliament, while Labour frontbencher Paul Flynn and Green MP Caroline Lucas suggested he should face prosecution.", "But Blair insisted: \"I did not mislead this country.", "I made the decision in good faith and I believe it is better we took that decision.", "I acknowledge the mistakes and accept responsibility for them.", "\"What I cannot and will not do is say we took the wrong decision ...", "As this report makes clear, there were no lies, there was no deceit.\"", "What does the Chilcot report say?", "Responding to the criticism that he had not exhausted all the options before sending in troops, Blair insisted that there was no \"rush to war\", and asked people to put themselves in his shoes.", "He said there had appeared to be evidence mounting on weapons of mass destruction; fears of a terrorist attack were growing; and he felt he had a duty to protect the country.", "He was increasingly critical of the Chilcot report as the press conference progressed, repeating several times that it said he was wrong to go to war without examining the alternatives.", "\"There are real lessons of political and military strategy, but I don't see where these are in this report,\" he said.", "Stressing the toll the decision had taken on him personally, Blair said he made the choice to put British troops in Iraq with the \"heaviest of hearts\", and that he now thinks about it everyday.", "This was the reason he chose to work on the Middle East peace process after leaving his role as prime minister, he said.", "It came after his former chief adviser, Alastair Campbell, said the issue would haunt Blair until his death.", "\"He will, for the rest of his days, think about that; it weighs heavily on him and all who worked with him,\" Campbell said, adding that it was the responsibility of a leader ultimately to make decisions, and that this was Blair's most difficult one.", "Blair called the press conference after the Chilcot report concluded that he had deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by the Iraqi regime as he sought to make the case for military action to MPs and the public in the buildup to the invasion.", "In a forensic account of the way Blair and his ministers built the case for military action, Chilcot found that Blair disregarded warnings about the potential consequences of military action and relied too heavily on his own beliefs, rather than the more nuanced judgments of the intelligence services.", "A memo published by Chilcot also revealed that Blair had written to the US president, George W Bush, eight months before the 2003 invasion, promising him: \"I will be with you, whatever.\"", "Blair claimed at the press conference that this did not mean he had committed to war at this point.", "\"It's not a blank cheque, and it wasn't taken as that,\" he said.", "He also said he strongly rejected the idea that soldiers had died unnecessarily.", "\"I will never agree that people made their sacrifice in vain,\" he said.", "\"I know some of the families cannot and do not accept that this is so; I know that there are those that can never forget or forgive me for taking this decision and think I did it dishonestly,\" he said.", "Chilcot identified two separate, key occasions in the buildup to the conflict, against the background of mass protests on the streets of London by the Stop the War Coalition, when Blair appeared to have overplayed the threat from Iraq and underplayed the risks of invasion.", "Why is the report being published now?", "\"In the House of Commons on 24 September 2002, Mr Blair presented Iraq's past, current and future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq's WMDs [weapons of mass destruction].", "He said that, at some point in the future, that threat would become a reality,\" Chilcot says.", "But Chilcot argues instead: \"The judgments about Iraq's capabilities in that statement, and in the dossier published the same day, were presented with a certainty that was not justified.\"", "The inquiry finds that the report, which subsequently became notorious as the \"dodgy dossier\", was deliberately aimed at maximising the perceived threat from Iraq.", "The foreword, in which the then prime minister said he believed intelligence \"established beyond doubt\" that Saddam was continuing to produce chemical and biological weapons, and hoped to produce nuclear weapons, was \"grounded in what Mr Blair believed, rather than in the judgments which the joint intelligence committee had actually reached in its assessment of the intelligence\", Chilcot finds.", "Separately, Chilcot contrasted the powerful language used by Blair in the House of Commons on 18 March 2003, when he was making the case for military action to sceptical MPs, with the more nuanced picture presented by intelligence at the time.", "Blair warned about the possibility of WMDs falling into the hands of terrorist groups, which he said posed \"a real and present danger to Britain and its national security\".", "But Chilcot points out that the UK's intelligence assessment was that:", "Iran, North Korea and Libya were considered greater threats in terms of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation.", "The joint intelligence committee believed it would take Iraq five years, after the lifting of sanctions, to produce enough fissile material for a weapon.", "There was no evidence that Iraq had tried to acquire fissile material and other components or \u2013 were it able to do so \u2013 that it had the technical capabilities to turn these materials into a usable weapon.", "Saddam's regime was \"not judged likely\" to share its weapons or knowhow with terrorist groups.", "In his statement after the publication of the report on Wednesday, Chilcot said that, at the time of his statement to the Commons: \"Mr Blair had been warned that military action would increase the threat from al-Qaida to the UK and to UK interests.", "He had also been warned that an invasion might lead to Iraq's weapons and capabilities being transferred into the hands of terrorists.\"", "The report also suggests that the Blair government's approach to making the case for war \u2013 including the \"dodgy dossier\" \u2013 undermined future public debate.", "\"The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the firmness of the evidence about Iraq's capabilities and intentions in order to influence opinion and 'make the case' for action to disarm Iraq has produced a damaging legacy, including undermining trust and confidence in government statements, particularly those that rely on intelligence that cannot be independently verified,\" the report says.", "Campbell was widely blamed at the time for \"sexing up\" the claims in the dossier, but he barely merits a mention in the report's executive summary, which focuses squarely on Blair's key role in taking Britain to war in the Middle East.", "Chilcot finds that Campbell largely left the task of writing the dossier to Sir John Scarlett, then chairman of the joint intelligence committee, and others \u2013 although Campbell did chair a September 2002 meeting at which the need for a \"substantial rewrite\" was agreed \u2013 and later gave a series of comments on drafts, including one urging Scarlett to \"cut the rhetoric\".", "Campbell's role in shaping the government's public statements about the case for going to war is set out clearly in the report.", "He argued over the Christmas break in 2002, for example, that the UK had to \"communicate better the threat and relevance to the UK\".", "The UK position \"should be that the issue of Iraq/WMD has to be addressed, we worked hard to get [the] UN route \u2026 and we're working hard to make that route work.", "But Saddam has to understand this is his last chance, and in the meantime we carry on military preparations\".", "Setting out the lessons that future governments should take from the dossier episode, Chilcot emphasised \"the need for vigilance to avoid unwittingly crossing the line from supposition to certainty\" and \"the need to be scrupulous in discriminating between facts and knowledge on the one hand and opinion, judgment and belief on the other\".", "As well as questioning the basis for many of Blair's public statements about the threat posed by Iraq at the time, Chilcot also underlines a series of failings in the style of government practised behind the scenes, criticised at the time as \"sofa government\", which he says failed to provide sufficient challenge to decisions made by a select inner circle.", "The inquiry identifies 11 separate \"decision points\" in the buildup to the conflict that could have benefited from \"collective discussion\" in a cabinet sub-committee, with advice from civil servants.", "It also criticises Blair for failing to consult more widely within the government about his promise to Bush \u2013 in a \"long note\" of September 2002 \u2013 that: \"I will be with you, whatever.\"", "The note was seen only by No 10 officials before it was sent, and was shared afterwards with the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, but not with the then defence secretary, Geoff Hoon.", "\"While the note was marked 'personal' (to signal that it should have a restricted circulation), it represented an extensive statement of the UK government's position by the prime minister to the president of the US.", "The foreign and defence secretaries should certainly have been given an opportunity to comment on the draft in advance,\" it says.", "You

Future growth the City of London was guaranteed after a new water supply was secured at the fresh water springs near the village of Byron (today a part of London) on the southern banks of the river in 1878. The construction of the hydraulic-driven pumphouse and a small reservoir on Chestnut Hill (today Reservoir Hill in Byron) led to the establishment of Waterworks Park, today known as Springbank Park, a long stretch of picnic and recreational area along the southern shore of the Thames River in Byron. The completion of the London Waterworks System in 1878, by building a dam at the park, had the effect of raising the water in the river upstream, and thus provided a beautiful stretch of some four miles of the park to be used for boating purposes.

the revolving door of guest hosts and auditions continued, a number of U.S. stations dropped Q from their lineup, including WBUR in Boston.", "While the show's U.S. distribution is not a significant source of revenue for CBC, it is used to trade for other programming, such as The World, which is co-produced by PRI and BBC World Service.", "And Q's U.S. presence helps the show enormously in

the connections that the artists and the creators made with the guests,\" said Witten.", "\"So we took that fork in the road, and felt that was delivering the most interesting revelations.\"", "Within CBC, it was widely believed that diversity would be an important part of creating the new Q \u2013 not just in the choice of its on-air host, but the staff as well.", "In fact, says Witten, it is an important value for the entire network.", "Two weeks ago, as she wrapped up a presentation to CBC's board of directors about her plans for the radio services, she raised the issue.", "\"What I said

(CFA) was established in 1968 by national, state, and local pro-consumer groups to advocate the consumer interest before the U.S. Congress and federal regulatory agencies.", "In the last several decades, it has broadened its mission to include advocacy on state issues, assistance to other consumer groups, and the delivery of services directly to consumers.", "Its role helping to unify the consumer movement is epitomized by the diversity of its membership.", "Today, in 2014, although a majority of its 276 member organizations are national, state, or local consumer advocacy groups, the CFA membership also includes state and local protection agencies, public power groups, credit unions, rural electric cooperatives, housing cooperatives, cooperative extension offices, credit counseling agencies, social justice groups, trade unions, and AARP.", "CFA was organized by reform-minded advocates during a period of change and social protest.", "Many of these advocates came from organizations established earlier in the century\u2014Consumers Union, industrial labor unions, and rural electric cooperatives, among others\u2014who viewed the late 1960s as a time when political conditions permitted the establishment of new consumer protections and agencies.", "In 1964, representatives of several of these groups headquartered in Washington, D.C., began meeting informally and planning strategy to advance consumer legislation.", "A year later, these activists began organizing a national consumer forum.", "Held in April 1966, this Consumer Assembly was cosponsored by thirty national organizations representing workers, small farmers, consumer cooperatives, and women, as well as other consumers.", "At the meeting, White House Consumer Adviser Esther Peterson urged the creation of a federation of national, state, and local groups to press for consumer legislation.", "These organizations formed a steering committee to plan the new federation.", "Leaders from Consumers Union, the Association of Massachusetts Consumers, the National Consumers League, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the AFL\u2013CIO's Industrial Union Department, the Steelworkers Union, the Credit Union National Association, the Cooperative League of the U.S.A., and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) were among those who worked the hardest to create the new organization.", "At the federation's first annual meeting, held in April 1968, fifty-six charter members elected board members and appointed NRECA staffer Erma Angevine as executive director.", "In developing the new organization, its founders were challenged by the fact that the organization's primary function was consumer advocacy, but at the time, few consumer advocacy groups existed, and most of these groups were run by volunteers.", "Moreover, the federation's income depended heavily on contributions from trade unions and consumer cooperatives (as well as from Consumers Union).", "To ensure that consumer groups controlled CFA, the charter defined nonconsumer organizations such as labor unions as \"supporting members\" limited them to two votes at the annual meeting.", "Consumer groups, including co-ops, could cast as many as twenty votes if they contributed at least $200 annually.", "Representatives of CFA member organizations had the authority to elect board members and to determine the consumer policies of the organization, which they accomplished at annual meetings of the organization.", "Recommended policies were presented at these meetings by subcommittees for individual issues areas, such as food and housing, after these recommendations had been reviewed by the chairs of all the subcommittees.", "Mark Silbergeld, longtime head of the Washington, D.C., office of Consumers Union, chaired this full committee for several decades.", "His skill played an important role in resolving differences among CFA's diverse membership.", "Erma Angevine served as executive director during an upsurge of consumer activism, most visibly that of Ralph Nader and his \"Nader's Raiders.\"", "Before joining CFA, Angevine had worked for major cooperative organizations, including the Consumer Cooperative Association, the Cooperative League of the U.S.A., and NRECA, where her work included directing women's activities and serving as consumer lobbyist.", "Her twofold mission was to take the lead on numerous consumer issues at a time when she had to build the organization from scratch.", "By 1969, with the help of board members, Angevine had persuaded 140 groups to affiliate with the federation.", "Their contributions of nearly $100,000 a year allowed her to hire two staffers.", "One of Angevine's greatest challenges was seeking to resolve differences among CFA members, especially those between relatively large trade unions and cooperative groups, which contributed most of the organization's income, and much smaller state and local consumer groups, which felt they were entitled to run the organization.", "This disagreement culminated in the withdrawal from the federation of eight state consumer groups, which then organized the Conference on Consumer Organizations (COCO).", "At the same time Angevine was seeking to build the organization, she also took the lead on numerous policy issues.", "As the consumer movement's chief lobbyist, Angevine involved CFA in dozens of congressional issues, developing position papers and fact sheets, mobilizing CFA members, and communicating with members of Congress and their staffers.", "Working closely with other consumer advocates, with cooperative and union lobbyists, and with congressional leaders such as senators Philip Hart (D-MI), Warren Magnuson (D-WA), and Paul Douglas (D-IL) and Representative Leonor Sullivan (D-MO), she helped win passage of key consumer legislation such as that dealing with truth in lending and truth in packaging.", "At the state level, CFA coordinated opposition to the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, which had been strongly influenced by creditors.", "Angevine monitored the actions of individual states, recruited volunteer attorneys to analyze provisions of the code, and circulated these analyses widely through the country.", "When she retired from CFA in 1973, she left behind a federation with a solid organizational foundation and much credibility.", "Carol Tucker Foreman succeeded Angevine as executive director.", "The daughter and granddaughter of Arkansas politicians, Foreman had worked on Capitol Hill, in the executive branch, and in the advocacy community (Planned Parenthood) before joining CFA.", "This experience and her own personal skills allowed her to heighten the influence of the federation.", "In this period, CFA's annual income available to support advocacy ranged from about $150,000 to $200,000, which supported five core staffers.", "Because of the effectiveness of Foreman and her staff, CFA was taken seriously on Capitol Hill and widely quoted in the press.", "High priorities were fighting inflation in the energy and food areas, and seeking to establish a federal consumer protection agency and a consumer cooperative bank.", "To encourage the election of a pro-consumer Congress, CFA established a Political Action Committee (PAC) that endorsed, but that did not make financial contributions to, congressional candidates.", "(This PAC was permissible because CFA operated mainly as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization.", "It was discontinued in the early 1990s, and CFA began functioning solely as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization several years later.)", "In 1977, Foreman was appointed assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and was succeeded as CFA executive director by Kathleen O'Reilly.", "O'Reilly had practiced law, including helping draft the first federal no-fault insurance legislation.", "At CFA, O'Reilly was known for her forceful consumer advocacy, testifying more than 200 times before congressional and state legislative bodies.", "During her tenure as executive director, O'Reilly led successful congressional efforts to reduce sugar price supports and expand protections against credit discrimination.", "She also worked hard on the unsuccessful effort to create a federal consumer protection agency.", "In early 1980, O'Reilly left CFA to run for Congress\u2014she later headed the Wisconsin Citizen Utility Board (CUB) for many years\u2014and was replaced by Stephen Brobeck, who has run the federation since then.", "Brobeck earned a PhD in American studies in the late 1960s, then taught at Case Western Reserve University throughout the 1970s.", "During this decade, he also proposed the creation of, and helped lead, a grassroots consumer organization, Cleveland Consumer Action.", "From 1976 to 1979, he served on the CFA board.", "Brobeck's greatest contributions to CFA have been as a builder.", "He led the expansion of CFA's membership and greatly reduced member conflict, in part by working with policy committee chairman Silbergeld to reform the policy resolutions process.", "He proposed and

mid-2005, after the existing airfield underwent an $11.5 million upgrade which included the construction of a new terminal building and the extension of the existing 1,500\u00a0m (4,921\u00a0ft) runway to 2,000\u00a0m (6,562\u00a0ft) to accommodate jet services from Virgin Australia. \n Up until September 2006, Sunshine Express Airlines provided daily services to the airport from Brisbane. The airline ceased all scheduled operations on 1 October 2006 after a proposed acquisition by Regional Express Airlines was terminated and an intention by QantasLink for the introduction of Brisbane services was announced. \n In 2006, the airport was the fastest growing in Queensland with passenger numbers almost doubling. Currently, plans are underway to further upgrade the airport to handle more jet services from other Australian capital cities. These plans involve the extension of the terminal to twice its current size, as well as a new cross runway (smaller than the main runway) to be used for general aviation purposes. In June 2017, Fraser Coast mayor Chris Loft and JETGO announced that the airline would commence two direct services per week from Hervey Bay Airport to Melbourne's Essendon Airport, as well as direct services to Brisbane. Due to have commenced on 21 July 2017, the service never commenced due to lack of bookings. "}}

Comet Astrobiology Exploration SAmple Return (CAESAR) mission, the agency picked in December 2017 for study.", "Dragonfly is scheduled for launch in 2026, arriving at Titan in 2034.", "The spacecraft will touch down in dune fields in the moon's equatorial regions.", "From there Dragonfly, effectively a drone the size of a Mars rover and equipped with eight rotors, will fly from location to location across the surface of the moon.", "Scientists plan to have Dragonfly makes its way to a crater called Selk about 80 kilometers in diameter.", "\"We think that, at Selk Crater, the three ingredients you need for life were mixed together,\" said Curt Niebur, lead program scientist for New Frontiers at NASA, during a NASA webcast announcing the mission.", "Those ingredients are water,

about the chemistry that eventually led to life, but we can go to Titan and we can pursue those questions.\"", "Dragonfly is designed to fly about 175 kilometers across Titan over two and a half years.", "The spacecraft will use a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to generate electrical power, storing it in a battery for use during flight and other mission activities.", "\"Flying on Titan is actually easier than flying on Earth,\" said Elizabeth \"Zibi\" Turtle, the principal investigator for Dragonfly at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.", "Titan's atmosphere, she said, is four times denser at the surface than on Earth, and the moon's gravity is one-seventh that of Earth.", "\"It's the best way to travel, and the best way to go long distances.\"", "Dragonfly will make extensive use of drone technology developed terrestrially, she said.", "\"This is actually technology that is very mature on Earth,\" she said in a later media teleconference.", "\"Really what we're doing with Dragonfly is innovation, not invention.", "We're applying technologies that already exist to another planet.\"", "Convincing NASA of that, however, was not easy.", "Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said that when the agency received the original Dragonfly proposal, if identified about 10 significant risks in its design.", "\"The science was so compelling that, when we looked at all the risks that were there, and there quite a number of them, we basically said we want to give them a chance.\"", "The Phase A study completed by the Dragonfly team eliminated those risks.", "One concern identified by reviewers was that a \"vacuum cleaner\" system used to collect materials for analysis by instruments inside the spacecraft could get clogged or contaminated by hydrocarbon materials commonplace on Titan.", "Niebur said the mission made \"some big design changes\" to lower the risk of clogging.", "Another area was demonstrating that Dragonfly could fly as expected on Titan, including its ability to fly autonomously.", "\"We can literally test as we fly\" here on Earth, Turtle said.", "\"We can really demonstrate its capability by flying here on Earth before we fly on Titan.\"", "One change from the original proposal is a one-year slip in the mission's launch date, from 2025 to 2026.", "That change will give the Dragonfly team more development time, although doesn't delay the mission's arrival at Titan since the original trajectory had a longer cruise period.", "\"The team could benefit greatly by some additional time to work through some of the challenges,\" Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division, said.", "\"From our perspective, this gives this mission the greatest chance of success.\"", "NASA hasn't selected a launch vehicle for Dragonfly, and launch costs, along with post-launch operations, aren't included in the $850 million cost cap for this New Frontiers competition.", "Dragonfly will use flybys of Venus and Earth after launch to reach Titan.", "Dragonfly was, anecdotally, the favorite among many planetary scientists over CAESAR.", "That mission would have flown to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the same comet studied by the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, and collected samples of the comet's nucleus for return to Earth.", "Zurbuchen said that he selected Dragonfly for three reasons, one of them being its science.", "\"The science is compelling,\" he said.", "\"We have questions about this world out there, Titan, that frankly only now we know how to ask.\"", "A second factor was the work it did to mitigate risks, and the third was the strong leadership of the mission.", "Zurbuchen praised CAESAR and its team, led by Steve Squyres, best known for being principal investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers and chairing the latest planetary science decadal survey.", "\"He has been a very aspirational leader for many of us,\" Zurbuchen said of Squyres.", "\"For many of us, he set the standard of what it means to build an integrated team.\"", "CAESAR, or a mission like it, could propose for later competitions, although Glaze said the next

Both sides claimed that there was never a formal working relationship between them and that the exchange of ideas and information that took place between them was a natural and normal consequence of their operating in the same region and countries since many years. \n In June 2012, a former SCL operative emailed K\u00e4lin about \"interesting developments\" in Malta: \"I can introduce you to the opposition leader, if that helps, he's young, very purposeful and open to international investment, and many say he'll win\". In May 2017, it was revealed that K\u00e4lin consulted with Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, and Minister of Justice, Owen Bonnici together with law firm Mishcon de Reya, to write to the investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, in an attempt to get her to remove speculative and defamatory blog posts. Daphne Caruana Galizia was a fierce critic of Malta's citizenship by investment program, accusing the Maltese government and Henley & Partners of collusion. "}}

Their two singles were reissued by Kitchenware and attracted notice including laudation from Elvis Costello. \n After the departure of Michael Salmon, the band recorded their debut album in a 24-track studio in Edinburgh on a budget of \u00a35,000. It features session drummer Graham Lant, and was produced by fellow Kitchenware artist David Brewis of The Kane Gang. The songs were written over a 7-year period, and the album was titled \"Swoon\", standing for 'Songs Written out of Necessity'. McAloon mostly avoided the material the band had been playing live for the preceding years, and instead favoured his more recent complex material, that would \"only work on tape\".\n The basic tracks were recorded in just one day, and put the band under intense pressure. During a session, McAloon made a crying Wendy Smith sing two words over and over for three hours. McAloon wrote piano parts for the songs despite being unable to play the instrument, and recorded the parts with the aid of drop-ins. "}}
