Could Have Zero Hurricanes in August)", "Multiple tropical waves are forecast to emerge off the coast of western Africa, potentially spinning up into tropical cyclones as they track westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, known as the Main Development Region (MDR) for Atlantic hurricanes.", "The National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that one such tropical wave moving off the African coast by Thursday bears watching for some development in the eastern Atlantic over the weekend.", "Another dry tropical wave, located near or just east of the Leeward Islands has our eye.", "The wave is currently moving west-northwestward into the southern Atlantic and northern Caribbean.", "The wave may reach more favorable conditions for development over the Bahamas into early next week if it can stay north of Hispaniola and Cuba.", "Chances for development are currently very low with this tropical wave.", "For the latest on this possible tropical development click here.", "Often referred to as African easterly waves, tropical waves are batches of energy and general spin in the atmosphere that develop due to temperature contrasts in northern Africa.", "(MORE: Africa's Role in the

easterly waves pushing off western Africa, across the MDR towards the end of the European model's ensemble runs.\"", "One of the reasons for this potential uptick in activity is that the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is expected to enter its active phase over the Atlantic Ocean and Africa regions, which often corresponds with an uptick in tropical cyclone activity across the Atlantic Basin's MDR, Ventrice added.", "Since this forecast is in the extended range, there is still uncertainty when it comes to computer model guidance, he cautioned.", "(MORE: What is the Madden-Julian Oscillation?)", "\"I think we are going to see some activity in the coming two weeks across the MDR, but there's a chance the models are not handling the tropics correctly and things end up less active than what is being touted,\" Ventrice said.", "For now, it is too early for any specifics, but it's a reminder we are in the peak of the hurricane season.", "Residents of coastal locations should have a hurricane preparedness plan in place every year no matter how active or inactive of a season is expected.", "### September is the Peak Month for Atlantic Hurricanes", "Historically speaking, September has recorded the most Atlantic hurricane formations since 1851 with 404.", "That's an average of two or three forming in the month every year, according to NOAA.", "August ranks second with 245 hurricanes, and October ranks third with 205.", "The period between Aug. 20 and Oct. 10 accounts for 60 percent of all Atlantic Basin hurricanes and 75 percent of all major hurricanes (Category 3 or stronger) in that basin, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a tropical scientist at Colorado State University.", "This graph shows that named storm, hurricane and major hurricane frequencies are typically the highest from August through October.", "Atmospheric conditions are more favorable over a much larger expanse of the Atlantic Basin during the peak months of August through October than early or late in the season.", "In June, the tropical cyclone formation zones are confined to the Gulf of Mexico, western Caribbean Sea or just off the southeastern U.S. coast.", "This is one reason for the relative lack of early-season hurricanes compared to August through October.", "Storms that form in these areas early in the season don't have far to go before reaching land.", "From July into August and September, the formation zone gradually spreads eastward until the so-called MDR, from the Lesser Antilles to just off Africa, is in play.", "This opens up the potential for Cape Verde hurricanes to make the more-than-3,500-mile trek from the eastern Atlantic Ocean toward the Caribbean islands or U.S. coast.", "(MORE: The Most Notorious Portion of the Atlantic Hurricane Season)",

Atlantic Basin.", "The AMO is trending negative this season after being predominantly in its positive phase since the mid-1990s.", "Each phase lasts 20 to 40 years and is a result of changes in the system of oceanic currents in the northern Atlantic Ocean.", "This oscillation is the climate background that all other climate and weather patterns build on in the Atlantic, including El Ni\u00f1o.",

In September 2012, Frank Cokayne (on bass guitar) joined Fishwick and Fletcher in the UK-based version of the band.

In contrast to debut albums from the Rolling Stones (whose take on Southern American rock & soul was fairly earnest) and the Beatles (who spread the word of rock & roll through sweet harmonies and easily digestible melodies), \"My Generation\" positively shoved at the boundaries of popular music. Townshend's fiercely original guitar experiments here predate the innovations of his later American rival Jimi Hendrix. "}}

In April 2013, also in Jordan, the United States had set up a $70 million program in the country \"that is training the kingdom's special forces to identify and secure chemical-weapons sites across Syria should the regime fall and the wrong rebels look like getting their hands on them.\"\n In April 2013, the Obama administration promised to double non-lethal aid to rebels, specifically to $250 million.

Thanks for coming to visit us at our office.", "Martin: Sure.", "Karthik: I am a CEO and a co-founder at SignalFx.", "Martin: When did you start this company and what made you start a company at all?", "Karthik:", "We started a company almost three years ago in January 2013.", "And my co-founder had been at Facebook for several years and he built monitoring systems at Facebook which was very state of the art different approach to solving monitoring compared to the monitoring solutions that had been on the market for twenty or thirty years.", "So he and I got together and spent some time looking at the broader market, the trends that were affecting the market to move towards cloud and software-as-a-service and felt that kind of problems that Phil had had at Facebook were the kinds of problems that everyone was beginning to see and without doubt an opportunity to start a company around it and so we decided to start SignalFx.", "Martin: Karthik, what is your background and how did it prepare you for starting a company?", "Karthik:", "I've been at startups pretty much my entire career, at least, when I started a company that's been startups.", "Right out of college I joined the company called Loudcloud which was in the cloud computing space before cloud computing really existed as a market.", "In fact, we had the name cloud in our name Loudcloud back in 1990/2000.", "I was there for a few years.", "And then I went to VMware and I was there for a long time.", "I started when the company was still relatively small as a startup.", "I got to grow up with the company and see it grow through various stages of growth and by the time I left it was almost a ten thousand-person company.", "So that was a real highlight, being able to be a part of a company from the early days and see it through to become a fairly substantial and significant player in the industry.", "Then, I went to another startup called Delphix for a few years but I always wanted to start my own company.", "When Phil and I started to talk about building SignalFx everything just seemed to click and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to go to realize my dreams of being a founder and build a company of our own", "and so Phil and I decided to start SignalFx.", "Martin:", "Can you shine some light on the first 12 months of starting the business and the operations?", "How was it like?", "Karthik:", "It's actually pretty boring for the most part but our model is a little bit different.", "I mean, every model is unique here in Silicon Valley but Phil and I were able to raise money right away so that the two of us had..", "I think, because we've both been in the Valley for a long time and Phil had a lot of credibility around the technology because he built a similar kind of solution at Facebook, we were able to raise money right away before we hired our team.", "And so we had the luxury of taking a little bit of time to build the right product and do it thoughtfully.", "So from the time we started the company until we launched the company it was almost a full two years.", "So the first year, really a lot of it was, you know, laying the foundation, determining what the technology and architecture was going to look like; recruiting our initial group of engineers, building out the core technology and getting to a point where we could begin to go and recruit beta customers.", "But the first year, it was pretty much all product development.", "Beyond at the very beginning there is the fundraising process, and then once that was done it was pretty much just building.", "Martin: And when did you start talking to initial customers?", "Karthik: Well, we had beta customers \u2013 I think we started our first beta about a year and a half after we started the company, roughly about a year and a half after beginning.", "And I guess the question is how did we find these customers are or what the -?", "Martin: No. Just when did you start looking for them so one and a half year \u2013 ?", "Karthik:", "Yes.", "Well, we wanted our product to be far enough along that we could actually deliver value to customers but we didn't want to wait so long that we would go too far down a path that wasn't necessarily appropriate for the marketplace.", "That is a very fine line to walk.", "We felt we hit that point about a year and a half and where we had enough of the core technology that could actually solve problems for customers who had a big enough pain point in the areas that we were addressing.", "So we found some of these early customers who were willing to invest the time in a young company and be design partners to us and work with us on our beta.", "So, yes, it was about a year and a half after we founded it.", "Martin: What was the customer feedback like?", "Did they say wow this is really awesome or did they say you are on a good track but actually we would like to change this and this in the feature in another way that could solve our pain points more efficiently?", "Karthik:", "I think generally the overall feedback was very positive.", "Since the very first customer has signed up, they loved the product and loved this base they were in.", "There is always feedback and the feedback tends to be in the places that you didn't expect, right?", "So little things that you missed because you think about the product the way that you would use it and then you go to a different organization that has a different model and maybe a different process and or a different way of doing things and you have to sort of adjust it a little bit to help solve their problems in ways that makes sense with their organizations.", "So those were the kinds of things that you have to build small features to help our product integrate better into a customer's environment and address them, scenarios that maybe we haven't thought about.", "But the core concept, the core product, the core value proposition we've never wavered from.", "almost three years ago we thought the value would be, continues to be where most people are getting value today and what people are excited about today.", "It is on the perimeter, there are a number of things that, as you engage with customers you realize that we really need to add these things because it'll make it much easier for customers to use and deploy and get the value out of our products if we have these additional components.", "# BUSINESS MODEL OF SIGNALFX", "Martin: Karthik, can you, please, elaborate a little bit on the value propositions with what type of pitch are you currently targeting your customers?", "Karthik:", "SignalFX is a monitoring service for monitoring application.", "So we are now not focusing on monitoring traditional enterprise apps like a SAP, Oracle.", "There's plenty of companies that have been doing that for the past thirty or forty years.", "But what we do as your building the next generation of new applications.", "If you're moving to a cloud architecture or even if you're running your own data center but you're building a modern application that has micro services or open source or it's just distributed in nature it is a very different challenge monitoring these modern apps versus traditional apps.", "And the big differences are:", "Number one, these applications tend to be updated more frequently.", "Instead of doing one or two updates a year, you have updates that happen once a week or once every couple of weeks.", "Number two, they tend to be more complex applications where it's not just one app running \u2013 one monolithic app running on one machine.", "It tends to be service oriented so you can have multiple services, all communicating with one another.", "So if something goes wrong you have to understand and pinpoint did it go wrong in service A or service B and how does that affect your entire chain of services.", "And then the third thing that is fundamentally different is that apps tend to be distributed.", "So you have because the VMs and containers are so lightweight and so easy to spend up in cloud environment you could have applications that have dozens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of components.", "And so in that world if you have to monitor large complex rapidly changing environment our belief is that the only way you can do that is through analytics.", "And you need to collect a bunch of information across all these different systems, perform real time analytics on it so that you can more practically identify trends and patterns as they emerge in your environment.", "And that's really our specialty.", "SignalFx is \u2013 we solve the monitoring problem but we do it through analytics.", "And so for our customers the benefit that they get is number one they get real-time complete visibility of everything that's happening to their applications.", "So keep in mind most applications these days are living breathing organisms and more and more they are critical to business.", "It's not like in the old days you have some back-office applications that is unavailable for a little while, it's a nuisance to people.", "But today these applications are your business.", "And if you have problems with that it materially impacts your business.", "You want to understand everything that's happening as it's happening.", "So we provide that visibility, we provide very high quality alerting.", "And so instead of getting alerts every time some random component is failing you get alerts when some meaningful trends are happening like significant subset of users in a particular region connecting with a particular device are experiencing larger than normally lengthencies.", "That is something that you care about.", "Those are the sorts of things that we help our customers really understand very, very, very quickly and very effectively.", "Martin: If I as a customer of yours, for example, have a very distributed kind of API system \u2013 how do I set up your SignalFx service?", "Karthik: There are lots of different ways of doing it.", "We have technologies that we provide out of the box.", "We have an open source agent that a lot of our customers use.", "It's one-line demand to get it installed and it collects all of the infrastructure metrics; it collects a bunch of application metrics if you're running open source components.", "If you're running MySQL, Postgresql, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Cassandra, these common open source, the platform will collect metrics from right out of the box and give you a comprehensive analytics and dashboards around it so you can understand what's happening to those.", "For your custom apps or for your APIs you would probably have some of those metrics put into log files and so we have log scrapers that can take those metrics, count them and send them into SignalFx or you can just send metrics directly into SignalFx from your applications.", "Every time an API is called, for example, you can send a metric into SignalFx that measures how long it took to process that request must including the number of dimensions around it, like which customer made that request, what region they are coming from.", "And then once all that data is in SignalFx you can start to slice and dice it in meaningful ways.", "As events are happening in your environment you can see it in SignalFx.", "Martin: Who do your target customers? And how do you basically acquire them?", "Karthik:", "Our target customers \u2013 it's basically anyone building an application who could use SignalFx.", "And there is a lot of application development happening in the technology community obviously.", "And so everyone here is a potential target for us.", "But more and more we see traditional enterprises also investing a lot in software development because\u2026", "As our investors, Marc Andreessen Horowitz likes to say \"Software is eating the world and every company is becoming a software company\" and so as they're investing in new software they also need a system like SignalFx to be able to observe as a software is out there in the wild, the operational characteristics of a software, performance metrics, to understand how the applications are scaling \u2013 all of these things that they need to understand they could use SignalFx to do it.", "The second part of your question \u2013 how do we acquire the customers?", "We are SaaS service, we do all the traditional marketing that you would expect business to do we.", "We have demand generation programs, we have a more concentrated community of buyers today.", "It tends to be operations teams.", "Some people also call them development teams.", "There are conferences where they tend to cluster and so we are present at those conferences.", "We also have a tremendous amount of word-of-moth with our existing customers.", "We have very happy customers and they tell their peers and then they come in and they find that since we've got a lot of inbound people finding us, hearing about us, coming to our website, signing up for a trial.", "We have a free trial.", "It's a very lightweight process.", "Someone can come and sign up, then immediately get value from the product and get a sense of the value they can get from us.", "So it's a very low friction, very easy way to get started.", "It's not a heavyweight sales engagement like classic enterprise software.", "Martin: Are you also using distributional partners like consulting companies?", "Karthik:", "As a young company the most important thing is to understand your own model very well first, I believe.", "So we've only been selling for six months.", "We launched in March.", "We've built our sales scheme.", "It's an exceptional sales scheme.", "We are really understanding all the nuances of our go-to-market motion ourselves but, absolutely, I think over time there's a lot of opportunities to work with distribution partners and services partners.", "But right now our focus is on understanding are own model very, very well before we start engaging with partners.", "Martin: It makes sense.", "Karthik, you said that you are basically is a SaaS model.", "What are the price drivers in your model?", "Karthik:", "The way our product is priced is based on the amount of data that customers send us.", "And we've done a lot of things to make it very fair and easy for customers to control what data they send into SignalFx.", "And the reason we do it this way, in the most traditional monitoring solutions prices are based on the number of servers that you are running.", "Unfortunately, that doesn't work well in the modern cloud environment because first of all these environments tend to be elastic.", "We talk to so many customers that could double or triple the number of VMs in their applications on a daily basis.", "They'll scale up and they'll scale down, pick hours will spike up and then they'll come down.", "So host count is a lot more fluid than it used to be.", "It's not quite as predictable as a metric of usage as it used to be.", "And secondly, not all hosts are graded equal anymore because you have some applications that you really, really care about and you want to collect a ton of data around those and other applications that are not critical and you don't collect as much data.", "And so it's not very fair to price the same for both of those.", "So what our customers do is, they can decide whatever data they want.", "Ultimately the primary cost of the solution like this is data storage, we just charge them on the number of data points that they send in, the data rate.", "The more data they send in, our storage class are higher.", "We have to retain that for our customers, and we tell them okay, there's a higher cost, the higher price.", "The less you send in, the less we have to store, the cheaper it is for the customer.", "It's a very fair model for customers; they can decide what they send, they can decide how they want to send it and they can download them down at a moment's notice.", "Martin:", "Karthik, you said that you are basically doing analytics based on the apps pinpointing where there might be an issue.", "Are you also doing predictive analytics for seeing maybe some patterns between your customers and seeing, there might be an issue for that kind of apps and there is some overlap in the usage of similar apps between some of those customers", "I see an issue rising at one customer therefore I may be predictive, tell another customer there might be an issue coming around \u2013 here is how you should solve it.", "Karthik: We don't do that because of number of reasons.", "Number one, our customers are very sensitive about data privacy, right?", "So we even anonymize, we don't do that \u2013 there is no pattern matching between different customers.", "It's completely isolated; there's no comparison of one customer to another.", "Secondly, I think one of the things that's fundamentally different is that every application is unique.", "And we have a massive fragmentation in a number of applications today compared to twenty years ago.", "Twenty years ago, everyone was running package software, and so you could look at Oracle trends across 10,000 customers.", "But today, Salesforce is very different from Work Day which is very different from Facebook, very different from Google and they are all unique applications that have their unique workload characteristics and unique hardware configurations.", "And so it doesn't make as much sense anymore to do those patterns across customers.", "There could be some benchmarking sorts of things down the road but at this point we're focusing more on giving the tools to the customers, the exploratory tools so they can richly understand their own data and look at the patterns in their own data and draw conclusions from that rather than trying to solve problems from looking at patterns across customers.", "Martin: Karthik, what have been the major obstacles over the last three years and how did you overcome them?", "Karthik:", "Well, I think as with any enterprise business one of biggest question marks is what your market model is going to look like.", "I think that when we started with the company we had a lot of conviction that there was a huge need for a product like what we built.", "And I think that's been validated over and over again, the more we talked to customers and the more we are around in the marketplace.", "I think the big question mark in the early days was what our go to market motion looks like; do we sell more to mid market accounts, enterprise accounts, where is the interest going to be?", "In the early days you have to spend a lot of time experimenting with different accounts.", "For us, it's turned out that there are all sorts of segments.", "We've got some great large customers that are traditional enterprises in large web skill organizations where they're essentially replacing their entire monitoring systems with SignalFx.", "We have midsize customers that move a little bit more quickly.", "And the deal sizes are not quite as big but you know they want to have more of that transaction motion.", "And so we've seen both models and then I think figuring out how to structure our team so that we can best equip both of those segments to be successful, that has been a kind of our biggest learning over the past year.", "And I wouldn't say it's a challenge but I would say that that was a big question mark when we went into our launch \u2013 what kind of go to market motion do we need to build for these different segments?", "Should we focuse more on one or another or gain the opportunity in both?", "And we've certainly seen the customers across the entire spectrum and so designing the go to market organization to support all of those customers has been probably the biggest area of investment for us as a company in the last 6 months.", "Martin: And what type of experience did you do in order to validate your go to market strategy?", "Karthik: With sales it was very easy.", "You see your customers signing up for your service.", "Are they willing to pay you?", "And so the experiments are \u2013 I think you experiment with messaging and you see which message has worked.", "In my experience, one of the things that we did very well is we hired some exceptional people in field who are very thoughtful, listen well, very intelligent.", "They have almost qualities like stem cells; they can adapt and become whatever model we need them to become and it was an incredible luxury to have people like that in the early days because we were able to really listen to customers, observe the patterns that were coming in and be able to figure out, ok, well, this is how we need to design our go to market motion versus assuming that it was going to be one way or another.", "I think we're able to adapt very quickly based on what was on the market.", "Martin: And how did you find those generalists sales people?", "Karthik:", "We interviewed a lot of people and I think we were just fortunate that we found some really high quality individuals who were willing to come and work with us.", "# ADVICE TO ENTREPRENEURS FROM KARTHIK RAU", "Martin: Karhtik, this is your first company that you've started for yourself.", "What type of advice would you share with other people thinking about starting a company?", "Karthik: Lots of things.", "You can spend a lot of time talking about this.", "I think what most of entrepreneurs would say is number one, you have to be very passionate about the idea because it is like a marriage \u2013 you are in it forever.", "You need to be excited about the team that you're starting working with; the co-founder chemistry has to be very, very strong; you have to really love what you're doing whether that's the product, the technology that you are building, or the team that you are building.", "So, I think that's absolutely critical.", "I think another thing that I would suggest to everyone is don't forget to enjoy the journey because I think a lot of people get so focused on \u2013 they are stressed about the outcome.", "That's natural.", "You are always trying to create the best organization that you can, but it's a beautiful journey.", "I think for me Mondays are my best days of the week.", "I get to come in and work with a fantastic group of people.", "Phil and I get to pick who we want to work with every day.", "We get influence it in a really meaningful way, the culture, the values that we care about.", "And that's a really beautiful thing.", "I think you have to stop and smell roses sometimes.", "That's one thing I think a lot of entrepreneurs forget to do.", "I think the third thing I would say is that every company is like a snowflake.", "It's all unique.", "Every company is absolutely unique.", "And people tend to pattern match and you will meet a lot of really smart people who have had great experiences and been very successful who will try to prescribe their approach to your company and everything changes.", "There is always some dimension that's changed.", "It could be the exact same technology and space from ten years ago versus today where markets are fundamentally different today versus 10 years ago.", "Your personalities are going to be different from other personalities, your founding team and culture everything is going to be unique so you really have to understand and introspect very well who are you, what do you do very well, what are your strengths, what are your weaknesses, what does your market truly look like, what's different about the market today versus five years ago, ten years ago and come up with a unique strategy because you are unique, your situations are unique.", "And you can get incredible input and advice from people but all of that input and advice comes with a bias and if you understand that bias you can then tease out the bias and just try to understand which of these things should be applicable to my world and which are not.", "But oftentimes it means you have to make a decision that is a lonely decision because it's based only on your company and what you have to do but it's very, very important that you make that decision on what's best for your company and not based on what's other people telling you.", "I think that's a very important thing to do when starting a company.", "And then I think the last thing I would suggest is from a personality point of view \u2013 I think you have to really, really enjoy the wins a lot more than you get down by the losses.", "Because every company has its ups and downs and as you go through the life cycle of a company early on by its very nature if you're in the market that's a new market that people haven't figured out as the big market yet you're going to have more people not understanding what you do very well understands what you do then someone else who is bigger and has more capacity to fulfill the demand with the market.", "So your timing has to be right from the beginning.", "You grow as the market is growing and that necessarily means that in the early days you're going to have fewer wins but you have to really relish the wins.", "That is everything I would suggest to people.", "Martin: You said that every Monday you are very happy to come to the office and work with great people and shaping the company and culture.", "What do you do to shape the culture of the company?", "Karthik: I think it starts first of all with who you hire.", "Culture, it's not something that you write up on a wall with a few bullet points.", "It has to be embedded in everything you do, every decision you make, every person you hire, what behaviors you embrace and reinforce and which behaviors you try to eliminate.", "I think it starts with the people you hire so you have to be very prescriptive about what are the cultural attributes that you care about.", "When we interview people we always have at least one person do a fit screen culture screen.", "I interview everyone that comes into the company and I'm always the final culture screen.", "And we're very prescriptive about what are the cultural attributes that we look for and that is very, very important.", "We've turned away a lot of people that are incredibly talented individuals but we felt that they didn't map to the kind of company and the culture that we wanted to build.", "So for us there are things like we really care about intellectual curiosity and someone, for example, like engineers that ask questions about the business and our business model are candidates that we really like.", "If there's a very talented engineer that shows no interest in the business, it really sways things to the other.", "Because we want everyone at our company to operate as business owners and we screen for that from the very beginning.", "And similarly on the sale side, when we are interviewing sales people we like them to ask and want to understand product strategy.", "And in that way we get everyone who when they are at the company, they are custodians of the business and they may be wearing a particular hat to be a salesperson or an engineer for their day-to-day jobs, but if they see something that they question there are not afraid to ask a question and then collectively as a team will make better decisions because we've got a variety of perspectives.", "So that's one independent thinking as another.", "Because as a start-up you have to take risks and you have to go against the grain sometimes and you have to make non obvious conclusions and so we really try especially in leadership positions to find people who are creative and will connect the dots in ways that other people don't.", "If we learn interesting things in an interview and we see different perspectives that we haven't seen before that's positive for us.", "There are all of sorts of these things that we try to do to screen for culture.", "So who you hire, the behaviors that you enforce, who you promote into management positions is one of the most important factors in building a culture, because I never would run a company we will see these are the behaviors that are rewarded.", "The behavior of managers is also very significant because that's again what people look at us \u2013 this is what the company values.", "You have to be very careful about who you promote, what behaviors they're displaying to the rest of the company, how you allocate different responsibilities to people, who you get what projects.", "Again it reflects to the rest of the company what qualities do we admire and respect.", "If we have a really big problem that we need to solve and it is very important for the company to solve it and we give these three people the role of solving that problem and it tells the company these are the three that were trusting to solve this big problem and they are obviously the skills that they have that the company really appreciates and respects.", "This isn't just about technical skills.", "It's technical skills, it's interpersonal skills, it's just all of these things become your culture.", "And I think it really starts with the people who you hire, who you promote, who you give certain roles too.", "And then myself and Phil, my co-founder, how we act every day is I think people look to us too, and the things that we value and how we treat people and treat partners and look at the opportunities.", "I think this is something that people look at as an example.", "There are so many different things that are involved in building a culture but I think the key is that you have to keep reinforcing certain tendency and do that across the entire company.", "Martin: Karthik, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.", "It was really the pleasure.", "Karthik: Thank you, Martin, very nice to meet you.", "Martin: Likewise.", "And the next time when you are starting a company you should really focus also in the beginning on the company's culture that you are hiring the right people not only based on the skills but also based on the attitude, because you want to minimize the asshole factor, for example, what do they work and be very curious about what they are working.", "Thank you so much.", "#### Share your thoughts and

Hershiser's 1984 streak, which was the longest scoreless inning streak of the year, was broken up on July 24 by a home run by two-time NL Most Valuable Player Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves. His streak included a blown save on July 8 against the St. Louis Cardinals and a nine-inning shutout against the Cardinals on July 19. \n Despite an emergency appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened his time to get in shape for the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and a participant in the 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3\u20134 win\u2013loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8\u20132, he pitched complete games on August 19 (a shutout) and August 24.

brainstorm about \"Mars colonial transport architecture.\"", "He says these words as though most people could look through their Monday schedule and find something similar.", "There are many remarkable aspects to SpaceX: for instance, the way it has challenged accepted rocket manufacture by making rockets for a fraction of the cost; the way it has become the first private entity\u2014rather than a country\u2014to successfully launch spacecraft into orbit and then return; the way it went from an idea in Musk's head to a company that resupplies the International Space Station and that hopes to soon ferry astronauts back and forth.", "But the most remarkable fact about SpaceX is that\u2014right from the start, before the first rocket had lifted an inch off the ground\u2014it was explicitly intended as the means to another, far more grandiose and idealistic end: colonizing Mars.", "Musk has said that he feels this is imperative for two reasons.", "One is that it would be an inspiring adventure and we need such goals.", "The other is the long-\u00adterm survival of humankind.", "If a calamity, self\u00ad-made or otherwise, destroyed life on Earth, as long as a human colony was established elsewhere, the species could endure.", "In Musk's mind, becoming multi-\u00adplanetary is just good common sense, a prudent move that he has likened to backing up a computer: \"You back up your hard drive....", "Maybe we should back up life, too?\"", "SpaceX exists to further this quest on several fronts: to develop the reusable rocket technology that would be needed to ferry large numbers of people, and large amounts of cargo, to Mars; to earn money to finance this goal; and to work out exactly what it would take to get to and from Mars in the way that Musk envisions.", "If you didn't know what \"Mars colonial transport architecture\" was\u2014that's what it is.", "Musk and his colleagues aren't vaguely hypothesizing about what people might like to

it's got enough capability to get all the way back here by itself.", "It needs a helping hand out of Earth's gravity well.", "So, technically, it would be the BFR and the BFS.\"", "As in \"Big Fucking

powerful social movement that's anti-technology.", "There's also growth in religious extremism.", "Like, I mean, does ISIS grow\u2026?\"", "Ironically, Musk himself recently advocated the use of nuclear weapons, during an appearance this fall on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.", "One possible strategy for making Mars habitable over the long term is to \"terraform\" it\u2014manipulate its environment so, in the simplest terms, the planet warms up, ice turns into water, and plants can be introduced, which will convert the atmospheric carbon dioxide into oxygen, with the goal of creating a stable and breathable atmosphere.", "(Musk's favored line on this subject: \"It's a fixer-\u00adupper of a planet.\")", "He told Colbert that there are slower and faster ways to do this, and then he proposed a fast way: \"Drop thermonuclear weapons over the poles.\"", "Musk has since somewhat clarified this, explaining that his idea (currently impossible, as if that's ever bothered him) is to have a small repeatedly detonating fusion bomb at each pole.", "\"Not really nuclear weapons,\" he says.", "\"I think a lot of people don't realize that the sun is a giant fusion explosion.", "And

it seems a little invasive to contemplate, given that unmanned NASA Mars missions are currently forbidden to even land near potential areas of liquid water, in case small bio-organisms from Earth contaminate Mars.", "Musk is a little dismissive of these concerns.", "\"As far as we can see now, there's no evidence of life on the surface of Mars at all\u2014the best case is really that there's subterranean microbial life.", "That's what we're talking about as, like, the most amount of life that would exist.\"", "But whether life exists on the planet or not, there seems to be a moral issue worth raising: Is Mars ours to mess with?", "To Musk, this is missing the point.", "\"There's certainly no moral issue if there's no life,\" he insists.", "\"I mean, in fact, it would be, I think, sort of immoral not to do it, if it meant preservation of life on Earth as we know it.\"", "Either way, when it comes to these big decisions about terraforming, he's also clear about how they should be made, and by whom: \"This would be up to the Martians.\"", "The Martians.", "By which he means\u2014and Musk can talk in a way that makes a thought like this sound not only sane, but

were launched) is as big as they come; it's what Tesla calls \"Autopilot.\"", "In Tesla's sedan\u2014the Model S, which I had test\u00ad-driven a week earlier\u2014you could already set the cruise control and the car would accelerate and decelerate according to the traffic it sensed all around it.", "But this update is more fundamental\u2014a huge step toward a self\u00ad-driving car.", "Beginning on Thursday, updated Tesla cars should be able to follow the lanes on a highway without driver steering.", "The car will also change lanes automatically\u2014all you have to do is tap the indicator and it will move over when it is safe.", "Oddly, Musk talks about these advances as though they're not even that big a deal.", "It might feel like the future to us, but to him it's as though this is an almost banal iteration of what people in his field know can be done quite easily already.", "(He quotes William Gibson's dictum: \"The future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed.\")", "But that's if the update works, of course.", "It is Monday evening, and from what Musk tells me, there's lots to be done before Thursday.", "\"The thing that's tricky,\" he

reality is that autonomous systems will drive orders of magnitude better than people.", "In terms of accidents per mile, it'll be far lower.", "Technologically, I think it's about three years away for full autonomy.\"", "Musk also acknowledges that we could reach a point where \"society may choose to make it illegal to drive your own car\"\u2014a possibility that he recently floated in public,

fuels.", "(If the electricity can be generated sustainably, he notes, then the advantages only increase.)", "And so once the historic disadvantages of electric cars (low range, slow and inconvenient charging, high cost) have been overcome, they become the obvious choice.", "His stated mission with Tesla is to accelerate the changeover so that it happens years earlier than it otherwise might; he

stations are set up to get their own power from solar panels, as eventually intended, then \"even if there's a zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel the country on the Tesla Supercharger network.\"", "And likewise, when Tesla worked out how to increase the Model S's already impressive acceleration, they decided to call this new option \"insane mode\"\u2014not just internally, but on the car's instrumental panel.", "And then, when they found a way to improve on even that degree of acceleration, they offered a new upgrade: \"ludicrous mode.\"", "Later, I ask him about all this.",

his cousins but was his idea.)", "He is a man with the rare problem of having more ideas for how to radically change our world than the time to realize them.", "Still, you do what you can.", "And so this Monday evening, his mind is on space suits.", "Right now, specifically, he needs to go see the latest secret prototype of a new kind of space suit\u2014the first to be made by a private rocket company for astronauts to wear into orbit and beyond, which he hopes will go into use in 2017.", "\"We're trying to have a good balance between aesthetics and functionality,\" he explains, sitting in his office at SpaceX.", "\"It's tricky to have something that works in reality and looks good.\"", "As with much of what Musk does, there is a plan, but then, behind that, there's often a bigger plan.", "To Musk, it's obvious that this new space suit not only needs to work well but also needs to look cool, because he needs people\u2014regular people like you and me\u2014to imagine themselves wearing it.", "\"If you've seen an advanced space suit in the movies, it looks a bit more like that.", "Unfortunately those things don't work.", "They just work in Hollywood.\"", "\"If we're to inspire the next generation to want to go beyond Earth,\" he says, \"they have to think they want to wear that suit one day.", "The easiest way to make a pressure suit work is to make it very bulky, and have lots of sort of things poking out.\"", "He laughs, and then offers another illustration that the way Elon Musk's mind works is both quite brilliant and quite entertainingly unusual.",

concede that I can't bring to mind a rear view.", "\"That's because they never show you that angle!\" he says, as though vindicated.", "\"It's really bad.\"", "Then he swivels round to the computer

satisfaction, only proves his point.", "\"They always kind of avoid the side image.\"", "He also explains the underlying physics dilemma: \"Imagine that you've got to be able to bend over, but it's rigid material\u2014then, when you stand up, it's gonna pooch out really significantly in the back.", "So we wanted to have something which would not do that.\"", "So, I ask, you can mitigate big-butt

good.", "Feel good.\"", "Do your suits look anything like space suits have looked before?", "\"They look a bit more like space suits in the movies,\" he says.", "\"If you've seen an advanced space

toward the coast to appear at an event where he was to be interviewed in front of an audience by a tech journalist called Sarah Lacy, and he was late.", "\"I didn't realize they'd actually paid to attend, so I was keeping all these people waiting that had paid to attend without me even realizing it,\" he says.", "\"I thought, 'Man, there's gotta be, you know, a better way.' \"", "What happened next is two kinds of absurd.", "First, he tells me, it was actually right as he sat there in his car, inching down Santa Monica Boulevard, that he not only thought, We need a new mode of transport, but imagined it, and in his head (Musk famously never writes things down) came up with a quite specific idea he thought would work.", "Second, when he arrived at his destination, he couldn't keep it to himself.", "\"I sort of shot my mouth off in the interview,\" he recalls.", "He would explain at the event that his idea was also inspired by his frustration at California's continually-delayed high-speed train link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, which he saw as disappointingly slow and crazily expensive.", "\"I said,\" he remembers, \" 'I think I've come up with a better way to get from one place to another.' \"", "This, in part, is what he explained.", "Musk: It would be for a fifth mode of transport.", "So right now we've got planes, trains, automobiles, and boats for getting around Earth.", "But what if there was a fifth mode?", "I've a name for it, which is the Hyperloop.", "Lacy:", "The Hyperloop?", "Is it like a Jetsons tunnel?Musk", "It's something like that, yeah.",

Francisco in under 30 minutes\u2026", "Lacy:", "You think this is", "possible?Musk: Yes, absolutely.", "Absolutely.", "Yeah.", "Over the next few months, when Musk was asked about it, he said that when he had time he might publish an open-source version of this Hyperloop plan for others to work on, and meanwhile he offered more opaque clues as to what his idea was (\"a cross between a Concorde and a rail gun and an air-hockey table\u2026if they had a three-way and had a baby somehow\"), which inspired lots of online speculation, much of it deeply skeptical.", "Despite prodding, though, he said little more for quite some time, and he published nothing.", "For one thing, as we know, he was a little busy.", "But he tells me now that there was also another reason for his reticence.", "\"In actual fact,\" he says, \"what I thought of wouldn't work, but I didn't realize that at the time.", "It was like a wrong precursor, sort of along the lines of a pneumatic mail chute.", "But the problem is, pneumatically things won't work because the friction of the air column is far too great.", "And then it heats up the air, the air expands, and it creates this enormous back pressure.", "That's why mail slots don't work at scale.", "You can have them over short distances, but not long distances.\"", "Pretty much anyone else might have left it there, but Musk didn't.", "He carried on thinking about it: \"I was like, 'Is there any other way to make this work?'", "Because I'd sort of put myself out there saying I could think of this thing\u2014it's gonna be pretty embarrassing to

published\u2014which turned out to be a surprisingly detailed, 58-page document packed with calculations, reasonings, schematics, and costings\u2014but though there were inevitably doubters, it soon became clear that there were plenty of people who could not see any reason why it wouldn't work, and a few who were ready to start building it and testing it out.", "There are now competing companies investing millions in Hyperloop prototypes.", "Musk hasn't endorsed any particular endeavor, but for his own part he's building a mile-long Hyperloop test track here in Los Angeles so that students can try out designs and compete to see whose prototype will go faster.", "And while there is a long way to go before the Hyperloop proves itself, no one has yet come up with a fundamental flaw that undermines his designs or his reasoning.", "You must be aware that other people don't think up new modes of transport in their spare time?", "\"Um, well, in this case it was just sort of sheer desperation,\" he replies.", "\"Of, like, I'd better think of something, otherwise I'm gonna have to tell people it doesn't work.\"", "Well, yes, but lots of other people have been desperate before now, and they still don't do things like this.", "He pauses, as though looking for a way to sidestep this.", "If so, he fails to find one.", "\"True,\" he concedes.", "Elon Musk has been asked many times to explain his success, and occasionally he has tried.", "He points to things he does that other people don't do\u2014actively seeking out negative feedback, for instance, and working really, really, really hard.", "But I think he knows that he's different.", "This is what he said once to NPR, back in 2007, before the first Tesla car hit the road, before the first SpaceX rocket took off:

to do it or anything.", "I just, I don't know, I can see the truth of things, and others seem less able to do so.\"", "Eight years later, he tries to boil down some more practical lessons for me.", "The things you've been working on the last ten years or so, would they be where they are now yet without you?", "\"Which things?\"", "Everything you've been doing at SpaceX and everything you've been doing at Tesla.", "\"Would they happen without me?", "Um, certainly some things wouldn't have.", "You know, I think probably not.\"", "So what is that that you're doing to make that happen?", "\"Well, you've got to convince great people to join the companies and then get them to work together in concert toward a clear goal with a strategy that's sensible.\"", "But surely there are thousands of people who are doing that.", "Why are you more successful than pretty much anyone else right now?", "\"Well, it's really because people, they either have a strategy where success is not one of the possible outcomes\u2014occasionally it's that.", "And then they don't change that strategy once that becomes clear, amazingly.", "Or they cannot attract a critical mass of technical talent, if it's in a technology-related thing.", "Or they run out of money before reaching a cash-flow-positive situation.", "That tends to be what occurs.\"", "The long-term goal of SpaceX is pretty modest: colonize Mars, establish a \"backup plan\" for all of humanity.", "Copyright: Ben Cooper", "Sure, but even so, there's other people who get over all those bars\u2026", "He laughs.", "\"No, they don't.", "There's very few.\"", "You really think those hurdles are enough to stop nearly everything?", "\"Oh yeah, absolutely.", "Probably very often when a company starts out, it's headed in the wrong direction.", "But it really depends on how quickly it can recognize that and take corrective action.", "But people tend to think that they're right even when they aren't right.\"", "An essential part of the Elon Musk tale of triumph is how close he came himself to complete disaster in the second half of 2008.", "\"Yeah, we had some really, really hard times,\" he says when I refer to this, \"and very narrowly escaped death as a company, both for SpaceX and Tesla.\"", "He has told the full story over and over\u2014how SpaceX had failed with its first three rocket launches and Tesla was struggling to make vehicles quickly or economically enough, and how, when the wider market crash then came, both companies were only kept going by Musk committing the remainder of his $180 million fortune from PayPal, to the point where he was reduced to borrowing money off friends for living expenses.", "And how, at the last minute, doom was averted: The fourth SpaceX launch reached orbit, and the company was awarded a $1.6 billion NASA contract; other Tesla investors agreed to match Musk's final $20 million investment and saw them through the most vulnerable moments.", "Even now, Musk gets uncharacteristically emotional talking about it.", "There's a very recent interview shot at the Tesla factory for Norwegian TV where Musk has to ask to halt the filming when they are discussing this period because he is tearing up.", "He seems surprised when I mention this.", "\"Well, I mean, I certainly have feelings!\"", "SpaceX received its biggest setback since those days earlier this year when, after eighteen consecutive successful launches, a Falcon 9 rocket on a resupply mission for the International Space Station exploded just over two minutes into its flight (a mishap they now believe was caused by the failure of a small metal strut supplied by a contractor).", "\"It was the first time that we'd had a failure in seven years, so most of the people at SpaceX were not around when we had the failures in the early days.", "Because we only were about 500 people or so, and now we're five thousand, so 90 percent of the people had only ever seen success.\"", "I ask him if there's something he's had to do to get people in a mindset where they're more scared of failure, but his answer is basically that a rocket blowing up\u2014or, to use the actual jargon, undergoing a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD\u2014should be enough to do the trick.", "\"I think it's now clear to them,\" he says.", "\"It's pretty obvious this is what happens if you don't do things right.\"", "Toward the end of our conversation, Musk starts getting periodic reminders, ever more insistently, that he is late to this meeting to review the latest space-\u00adsuit prototype.", "No one outside of a few select insiders has seen the suit, I am told, but eventually he invites me to come take a look, as long as I don't describe the suit itself.", "Earlier in the day, I'd been taken on a tour of the SpaceX factory, within which there is an area that approved guests are allowed to tour, where the rockets, capsules, and engines are fabricated.", "(First, though, you walk past the Iron Man suit, which is here presumably because another key part of Musk lore is that Jon Favreau and Robert Downey, Jr., used aspects of Musk as the basis for the movie version of Tony Stark; Musk also has a cameo in the second film, trying to buttonhole Stark about his real-life electric-plane idea at a party.)", "There's nothing boring about the inside of a rocket factory\u2014this is where SpaceX puts together every part of the rocket and capsule, fabricating nearly everything themselves\u2014but I also knew there were areas that no one is allowed to see.", "We head into one of these areas now, until we reach a glass-\u00adwalled room identified as space-suit development.", "Inside, a man is waiting, a little awkwardly, in a next\u00ad-generation SpaceX astronaut suit, visor open.", "He stands there for the next 20 minutes as Musk and his team discuss it.", "Other versions, presumably earlier or alternative prototypes, hang on a rack in the back of the room.", "Musk is not at all overbearing, but he asks a lot of very specific questions\u2014about fabrics, about colors, about placements\u2014and he makes comments about what is and is not flattering.", "They discuss some of the practical constraints imposed by the fact that this suit has to work in space.", "There's also quite a lot of laughter.", "Musk seems both pleased and dissatisfied with what he is seeing; he has plenty of suggestions for improvements.", "Still, I think it would be fair to say that his description\u2014more like space suits in the movies\u2014is a pretty good one.", "And I trust he

Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting)\u00a0\u2013  for example, when interpreting out of Estonian into Maltese. Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast. While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from \u20ac118,000 per day to \u20ac8,900 per day."}}

"claim_context": "\n The NFL Draft, which is officially known as the \"Player Selection Meeting\", is held each April. The draft is used as the primary means to distribute newly available talent (primarily from college football) equitably amongst the teams. Selections are made in reverse order based on the previous season's record, i.e., the club with the worst record from the previous season selects first. Through 2009, only two exceptions were made to this order: the Super Bowl champion always selects last (32nd), and the Super Bowl loser second to last (31st). Beginning in 2010, teams making the playoffs have been seeded in reverse order depending upon how far they advance. The draft consists of seven rounds. Teams have the option of trading selections for players, cash and/or other selections (including future year selections). Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. The Patriots traded their first-round pick six times (1972, 1974, 2000, 2009, 2013, and 2017). "}}

Simultaneously loathed by some of the populace and loved by architectural purists, the building was designed in an International Modern style between 1945 and 1953. A number of the original fixtures and fittings designed by Scott still exist, including terrazzo floor tiles, and large timber wall panels.\n One of the first modern buildings in Dublin that attempted to integrate art and architecture, utilising elements like glass facades and a pavilionised top storey, the building won the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) Triennial Gold medal in 1955. It was featured on the highest value stamp issued in the \"Architecture\" definitive postage stamp set issued in 1982 by the P&T, the forerunner of An Post. \n The Eblana Theatre was originally intended as a newsreel venue. The Eblana Theatre is in the basement of the building."}}

He exhibited \"Lucy\" in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found. When Wilson acquired another \"equally lovely\" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled \"The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art\".\n Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, as hundreds of people attended the receptions. The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art."}}
