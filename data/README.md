* `entailment_retrieval` includes the WiCE dataset for entailment and retrieval task. `claim` includes data with the original claims and `subclaim` includes data with the decomposed claims (finegrained annotation by using Claim-Split).
* `non_supported_tokens` includes the WiCE dataset for non-supported tokens detection task. We only provide annotation for sub-claims that are annotated as `partially_supported`. We filtered out data points with low inter-annotator agreement (please refer to the paper for details).
