Stefani was exhausted by the recently completed tour, and shortly afterwards suffered an emotional breakdown, which she spent in bed crying.\n During their first day of work, the two wrote a song titled \"Fine by You\", which Stefani later described as \"a stupid love song, but really good\".

Triptych.", "There is the London of the 1890s, and the rent boy Jack Rose; the London of the late 1990s, and the male escort David; and the London of the 1950s, and the painter Colin Read.", "The three stories explore a subculture and an underworld that is hidden from the everyday, yet whilst they are historically and socially distinct tales each one echoes a universal experience.", "As a

"I thought it would be interesting to reverse the story and make Wilde a bit player in Jack's life.", "When I finished the story I started to think about how it could become a novel by having three narrators and exploring three areas of gay history.", "It made sense to have one story in the '50s because that was characteristically a period of great secrecy in which you were risking everything.", "There was constant harassment from the police, and potential imprisonment.", "I wanted the character of Colin to be an artist because of the themes of representation in the book, and the link with the painter in The Picture of Dorian Gray.", "Then it made sense to jump forward another fifty years.", "It was only later that I thought of linking the stories.\"", "London Triptych is such a

"\"Characters speak to you.", "I often say to my students that if you stumble across an interesting character you should stick with them and listen to them.", "It sounds crazy, because the idea of the author as a god who is constructing things is a dominant one, but I think it helps to be passive in relation to characters and stories and let the things come to us rather than actively fixing it all together.", "Let the story appear and unfold.\"", "Throughout London Triptych the painter Colin is building toward his first major work, his own London Triptych.", "It feels so right when his story comes together and this painting is revealed that I ask Jonathan if he always had this conclusion in mind.", "\"The triptych was a very last detail.", "The book was originally going to be called Feasting with Panthers, which is a phrase that Wilde used about the boys he used to hang out with.", "And I still have a reference to that at the end.", "My agent didn't like the title, and when I did a search I found that there were two books in the last ten years that had that title.", "I wanted London in there, and the title triptych reflected the three stories, so I decided at the last minute to have Colin working on his own triptych.\"", "This may sound like an accident, and yet it is far more like evolution by natural selection.", "It is one of the reasons that the book is so immediate, and the narrative so genuine.", "This is almost the opposite of what I expected when I first read the blurb.", "The 1950s again?", "Oscar Wilde again?", "Rent boys and the gay underworld again?",

this disarming, bewitching quality to the writing.", "The book had generated such a buzz within weeks of its publication that Gay's the Word bookshop had to fit in two readings on an evening when one was originally scheduled.", "I talked about the book to the manager, Jim McSweeney, and we agreed that it was the best gay fiction we'd read since Neil Bartlett's Skin Lane.", "London Triptych is on the shortlist for The Green Carnation Prize, an award for gay men's fiction and memoir that, coincidentally, also makes its debut this year.", "And that circles back to Oscar Wilde again.", "The green carnation was a secret signal to others of a similar persuasion and the title of an 1894 novel in which Wilde appeared thinly disguised.", "As someone who finds The Picture of Doran Gray overrated, and Wilde generally quite tiresome, I ask Jonathan what it is about the man and his work that continues to fascinate educated gay men.", "\"I think that what Wilde represents, or came to represent, was the model of modern homosexuality,\" he begins.", "\"I think the hold he has is that we see someone in the middle of what is characteristically a rather dull and conformist age, the Victorian age, deliberately being against the norm in a very brave way.", "In a similar way to Crisp we see him as a pioneer.", "As gay men we like the idea of self-invention.", "How many of us have moved to the city and reinvented ourselves according to how we would like to be?", "I think Wilde is our glorious leader in that sense.\"", "Then it is more his life than his writing?", "\"The writing is something else.", "Famously he said I put my talent into my writing and my genius into my life.", "The writing is sublime and it is pitching itself against the norm.", "He was queer before queer was invented.", "Everyone else was writing heavy, verbose works, and he wrote slim books that were ornate and poetical and refused to be sucked into the realist machinery of Victorian fiction.\"", "Then he adds, \"Of course, he was gloriously funny, which goes a long way.\"", "I remain unconvinced about Wilde, whom I find to be too much about the shiny surface, too much about the art of deflection.", "And so I return the idea of the writer listening to the voices of the characters if only because I was taken with how Jack's voice stands clear and honest against Wilde's self-important monologues.", "It is a loaded question, consequently, but I ask Jonathan if he has a favourite of the three voices.", "\"It's hard to say because I became really fond of all three of them.", "It's interesting to hear which characters other people like.", "There are some who really can't stand Jack and others who think he is the most adorable.", "A friend of mine didn't like Jack because of what he did to Wilde.", "I liked Jack because it was refreshing and liberating to write in a voice that pre-exists all the moral and psychological and social structures that pen in desire in the 20th century.", "He comes from a class that is just going to do and he finds a way of doing.", "And it's arguably his proximity to Wilde that corrupts him, and makes him reflective, and that reflection makes him do what he did.\"", "In the midst of all the ideas, and the emotional life of the characters in London Triptych, is a fair amount of sex.", "\"It was very important to me that it was if not sexy then at least sexual.", "And sexual in a very different way, one that wasn't necessarily pornographic.", "We compartmentalise genres so easily, so problematically, and I think it's a shame.\"", "He pauses and then adds, \"Anyway, you can't have a novel about male prostitution and not have sex in it.", "It was important to get it right and I was concerned about it because either it would be totally unpublishable or it would be pigeon-holed as 'that dirty book'.\"", "London Triptych is one of those rare cases in which that balance works and does not feel spurious or forced.", "It is sexy rather than just having sex in it.", "For the reading at Gay's the Word, Jonathan chose one segment from each narrative.", "For Jack he read a graphic scene in which Wilde takes him to an orgy.", "It is, of course, nothing less than Dionysian.", "When we're talking about this element of the book he says, laughing, \"I'm waiting for someone to say, 'I had the best wank when I was reading your book'.\"", "There is something of a mischievous turn to the conversation at this point, and as we are talking about the character David, Jonathan adds that no one has yet asked what he thought they'd ask about him.", "And what would that be?", "\"Whether his story is autobiographical, whether I'd dabbled in prostitution.\"", "I nod.", "\"I have an answer prepared,\" he says with a smile.", "\"No, but I did know Oscar Wilde.\"",

In contrast, the competing Magnuson bill was similar to Bush's proposal to vest control in a panel of top scientists and civilian administrators with the executive director appointed by them. The Magnuson bill emphasized basic research and protected private patent rights. A compromise Kilgore\u2013Magnuson bill of February 1946 passed the Senate but expired in the House because Bush favored a competing bill that was a virtual duplicate of Magnuson's original bill. A Senate bill was introduced in February 1947 to create the National Science Foundation (NSF) to replace the OSRD. This bill favored most of the features advocated by Bush, including the controversial administration by an autonomous scientific board. The bill passed the Senate and the House, but was pocket vetoed by Truman on August 6, on the grounds that the administrative officers were not properly responsible to either the president or Congress."}}

In contrast to debut albums from the Rolling Stones (whose take on Southern American rock & soul was fairly earnest) and the Beatles (who spread the word of rock & roll through sweet harmonies and easily digestible melodies), \"My Generation\" positively shoved at the boundaries of popular music. Townshend's fiercely original guitar experiments here predate the innovations of his later American rival Jimi Hendrix."}}

discrimination as an unlawful employment practice.", "Twenty-one years later, in 1989, Nevada passed legislation that required employers to provide pregnant employees the same benefits provided to other employees due to sickness or disability related to a medical condition.", "Fast forward another 28 years.", "On June 2, 2017, Governor Sandoval signed into law Senate Bill No. 253, which greatly expands the legal protections for pregnant employees.", "The new law, the Nevada Pregnant Workers' Fairness Act, is actually much broader than the name implies.", "The Act makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to provide a reasonable accommodation to a female employee or applicant for a condition relating to pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition.", "It is also an unlawful employment practice to take adverse action against, or deny an employment opportunity to, an otherwise qualified female employee or applicant due to a request for, or use of, a reasonable accommodation.", "An employer, however, may take action in relation to the employee or applicant based on a bona fide occupational qualification.", "The terms \"condition relating to pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition\" are defined to include a \"physical or mental condition intrinsic to pregnancy or childbirth.\"", "This specifically includes lactation and the need to express milk for a nursing child.", "As such, it arguably provides broader protections for lactating employees and imposes potentially greater requirements on the employer than the Affordable Care Act's amendments to Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act.", "\"Related medical condition\" is also defined to mean \"any medically recognized physical or mental condition related to the pregnancy, childbirth or recovery\" from the same.", "The Act states that this includes: mastitis or other lactation-related medical condition, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and post-partum depression.", "It also includes the loss or end of pregnancy and the subsequent recovery.", "This list is not all-inclusive.", "Similar to requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 6 of the Nevada Pregnant Workers' Fairness Act requires the employer and employee to engage in a \"good faith and interactive process\" to determine an effective and reasonable accommodation.", "This process is triggered when a female employee or applicant \"requests an accommodation\" for a protected condition.", "The employer is permitted to require a statement from the employee's physician concerning the specific accommodation recommended.", "Section 6 gives examples of some possible reasonable accommodations: modifying equipment, revising break schedules, and providing space other than restrooms for the expressing of milk.", "It also provides examples of job modifications that may be reasonable, such as assistance with manual labor (if manual labor is incidental to the employee's primary work duties), light duty, and temporary transfer to less strenuous or hazardous positions.", "Other reasonable accommodation examples include restructuring the position and providing a modified work schedule.", "The Act clarifies that, in accommodating the employer, the employer is not required to create a new position or discharge or transfer any employee with more seniority unless the employer has or would take similar action to accommodate other classes of employees.", "In addition, an employer may not require a female employee or applicant affected by a condition relating to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition to accept an accommodation that she did not request or choose.", "While the employer clearly cannot force an unwanted accommodation on the employee, both have a duty under the Act to engage in \"good faith\" in the interactive process.", "Exactly what this means is unclear and will probably be the subject of future litigation.", "In addition, the accommodation must be reasonable.", "Section 7 of the Act creates a burden-shifting test.", "If the employee or applicant makes a prima facie showing that she requested a reasonable accommodation, the burden shifts to the employer to prove undue hardship.", "The bottom line is if the accommodation requested by the employee or applicant is reasonable, the employer will have to accept it.", "Employers are also prohibited from requiring female employees who are affected by a condition relating to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition to take leave from employment if there is a reasonable accommodation that would allow the employee to continue to work.", "That said, it is clear the Act contemplates leave as a reasonable accommodation.", "In fact, Section 5 of the Act includes in its definition of adverse employment action \"refusing to reinstate the employee to the same or equivalent position upon return to work.\"", "The Nevada Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act applies to employers with 15 or more employees.", "Employers who are contractors licensed under Chapter 624 of the Nevada Revised Statutes have a partial exempt from the Act's requirements.", "Such employers are not required to provide a place other than a restroom to express milk if the employee is performing work at a

include manual labor to accept an accommodation or take leave from employment.", "Employers subject to the Act are required to provide employees three distinct written or electronic notices.", "The notices must inform employees that they have the right to be free from discriminatory or unlawful employment practices pursuant to the NRS 613.335 and Sections 2 - 8 of the Act.", "The notice must

The stereoscopic 3D effect was alternately praised and dismissed: Matt Miller of \"Game Informer\" wrote that the feature \"doesn't add anything to the experience\", while Aziz described the feature as \"fantastic\", considering its use in \"Anniversary\" to be more subtle and pleasing than in other games.

of ulcerative colitis, likely caused by intense stress\u2014but it was not the whole truth.", "Although Lawrence did not testify in person, a transcript of an interview he gave condemning Oppenheimer was presented at the hearing, and it included the words \"[Oppenheimer] should never again have anything to do with the forming of policy.\"", "Several other members of Lawrence's lab team also testified against Oppenheimer, including Luis Alvarez, Wendell Latimer, and Kenneth Pitzer, apparently united against their colleague and the idea of political dissent in the scientific community.",

status as a Nobel laureate.", "In Big Science: Ernest Lawrence and the Invention That Launched the Military-Industrial Complex, Michael Hiltzik depicts Lawrence as a man of unique strengths and inescapable weaknesses.", "As the title suggests, Lawrence's strengths perfectly positioned him to transform the way science, particularly nuclear physics, was done, from benchtop experiments in

Hiltzik describes as a \"method for artificially driving subatomic particles into the nucleus with enough energy to give physicists a clear picture of what it was made of.\"", "One cyclotron led to another, each larger and more powerful than the last.", "Lawrence's use of big equipment and big teams of scientists, who were needed to keep the cyclotrons running, was atypical for the field.", "Hiltzik points out that the father of nuclear physics, Ernest Rutherford of the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, distrusted the cyclotron and believed that great discoveries could still be made with simple tabletop equipment.", "Lawrence transformed this romantic notion of the lone, scrappy scientist working in his tiny lab into that of big science.", "Lawrence encouraged an atmosphere of collaboration in the Rad Lab, unlike the standard practices in Europe and the rest of the United States.", "Each member of his team focused on one chemical element, bombarding that element's nucleus, while Lawrence acted as overseer.", "He encouraged curiosity and exploration for their own sake and recruited team members from chemistry, medicine, and engineering as well as

for her experiments.", "Lawrence, however, created a trifecta of steady income from academia (through Berkeley), government, and foundations.", "Lawrence's interdisciplinary style of research actually increased the number of potential funders.", "When he discovered that foundations, including the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, were interested in funding the use of isotopes in cancer research, he tailored his pitch to them.", "Lawrence also understood the need for a little spectacle, and on his 1935 East Coast lecture tour\u2014a thinly veiled fund-raising campaign\u2014he drank a glass of radioactive salt water at each stop and then used a Geiger counter to demonstrate the radioactive sodium's circulation throughout his body.", "He referred to these kinds of activities as \"the vaudeville.\"", "Sometimes Lawrence's personal traits led him astray.", "Early in his career a discovery might so excite him that he would fail to do the careful work required to confirm his results.", "At the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Lawrence used his cyclotron observations to suggest that deuterons could explode when hit hard enough, which directly challenged research coming out of the Cavendish, the place where artificial nuclear fission had first been discovered.", "After the New York Times and Time published pieces on Lawrence and his new theory, the Cavendish tested it and disproved it.", "They found, as Hiltzik bluntly puts it, that \"Lawrence's targets were contaminated\u2014his supposed great discovery the product of poor technique.\"", "Lawrence refused to believe his theory was faulty, continuing to promote it until his childhood friend Merle Tuve, also a renowned physicist, checked his results.", "\"Dear Ernie,\" Tuve wrote, \"we reached the astounding conclusion that we were unable to check a single one of the observations which you have reported.\"", "Lawrence was forced to admit his error.", "To add insult to injury, scientists at the Cavendish discovered two new isotopes\u2014tritium and helium-3\u2014while performing the same experiments.", "After more such mistakes Lawrence learned his lesson and, according to Hiltzik, reoriented his laboratory \"toward much more careful research.\"", "Lawrence's efforts paid off when he found a new radioactive isotope of sodium in 1934.", "Rather than rushing to make an announcement, Lawrence painstakingly reviewed his work and detailed his methodology in a long report sent to the journal Physical Review.", "His work was of great use for research in the physics and medical communities, and his more mature approach buoyed his reputation.", "Lawrence went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for the creation of the cyclotron and for the discoveries he made with his machine.", "Still, his inability to correct for all his habits of mind led to some serious professional mistakes, including his consistent advocacy for keeping politics out of the Rad Lab.", "Lawrence believed scientific work to be removed from the political realm, and he did not approve of his staff discussing politics in the lab or having opinions about the political implications of their research.", "Lawrence felt scientific activism led to \"frittering away so much time and energy on political problems, when [the scientists] could be devoting themselves to scientific pursuits.\"", "But Lawrence's career took him through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, and he alienated many talented scientists who weren't willing to keep politics out of their lives.", "Despite his assertions Lawrence was not truly apolitical.", "The funders who kept his cyclotrons running and with whom he rubbed shoulders were often very conservative men, and they influenced him.", "When Lawrence received a government Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant during the Depression to hire out-of-work shop craftsmen, many of his private foundation funders balked at the idea of being associated with a New Deal program.", "Ludwig Kast of the Macy Foundation, one of his largest funders, worried that if the WPA was overturned by the Supreme Court, the foundation's and the WPA's dual support of the Rad Lab would be incriminating and indicate \"that [the foundation has] something to do with sinister communist tendencies.\"", "In response, Lawrence removed all acknowledgment of WPA funds from research papers involving work supported by the Macy Foundation.", "Despite his great success in executing his big scientific ideas, Lawrence failed at managing his lab in this one way: he could not keep politics out.", "In 1947, with McCarthyism under way, the California legislature's Un-American Activities Committee began to investigate security at Berkeley, considered a sanctuary for leftists by committee members.", "Their concerns moved the AEC, under pressure from the House Un-American Activities Committee, to form regional security boards.", "Jack Neylan, a personal friend and patron of Lawrence's and a regent at the university, headed the board at Berkeley and began investigating members of the faculty for Communist sympathies.", "Lawrence did not view these investigations as a systemic problem: he \"accepted the rules, focusing his efforts on a defense of the accused rather than an attack on the system.\"", "He saved a number of Rad Lab staffers from being fired by acting as a character reference, but he would not speak out against the investigations themselves.", "His primary motivation in getting involved was to keep his team intact.", "Outside of the Rad Lab he stayed away from the government's inquisition.", "Frank Oppenheimer, Robert's brother and a former Rad Lab staffer, was accused of Communist activity while working at the University of Minnesota, in a post for which Lawrence had heartily recommended him.", "Lawrence refused to let Frank visit the Rad Lab while he was under suspicion and even asked a mutual friend to rescind a dinner invitation to him.", "The accusations eventually cost Frank his job.", "By 1949 anti-Communist pressure had escalated, and all Berkeley appointees were required to take an oath that they disavowed the Communist Party and did not support \"any party or organization that believes in, advocates, or teaches the overthrow of the United States Government.\"", "This demand outraged many of the faculty, especially those who were immigrants and had lived under totalitarian regimes in Europe.", "What Lawrence saw as \"byzantine quibbles,\" members of his team saw as a violation of academic freedom.", "When physicist Gian-Carlo Wick declined to take the oath, Lawrence argued with him; Wick refused to back down, and Lawrence told him to \"get the hell out of the Rad Lab.\"", "Those who refused to sign the oath were dismissed.", "Many of the people who did sign began to look for other positions, as their once creative, open environment had soured.", "In the end the Rad Lab lost vital talent.", "Four years later Lawrence's testimony led to the removal of Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance.", "The physics community did not look kindly on Lawrence's involvement.", "As Hiltzik writes, \"A great deal of obloquy fell on [him] and his colleagues at the Rad Lab, who had stood united, and virtually alone, against Oppenheimer.\"", "Despite his great success in executing his big scientific ideas,

He did not oppose the investigations of Oppenheimer or others, tending to distance himself from those under investigation rather than supporting them. He said he was unable to testify at the Oppenheimer hearing because of illness. On April 26, Lawrence suffered a severe colitis attack. The next day, Lawrence called Lewis Strauss and told him that his brother, a doctor, had ordered him to return home and that he would not be testifying. Lawrence suffered with colitis until his death during colostomy surgery, on August 27, 1958.

student-edited news publication.", "Dating back to 1921, and notable for coining the phrase \"been there, done that\", it documents more than eight decades of student activism, along with the myriad misdemeanors of straight-laced private school boys with Prime Ministerial ambition (for more on this, see pages 6-7).", "Six years shy of a century later, without editorial consultation and in a confidential meeting, the USU has decided to axe its only print publication, BULL Magazine.", "Rachel Hills, who edited the Union Recorder in 2002, cites the experience as an important learning curve.", "\"I started writing about student politics towards the end of my tenure\u2026", "I think mostly through UR actually, I'd critique the Union and things that were happening on the Board.\"", "Hills notes that Union oversight of the magazine was \"fairly minimal\".", "According to Hills, though the UR was less radical than Honi, it had its fair share of controversy.", "\"Part of the reason that we had to have the head of the Women's Committee look over our issues was because on one of our covers, there was an image that was considered to be sexist.", "That was the issue that I edited, and I was trying to comment on female gender roles.", "\"It's kind of ironic, because I write about feminism now, and I wrote about feminism then, and I certainly identified as a feminist at that point in my life,\" says Hills, who lives in New York and recently published her first book, The Sex Myth: The Gap Between Our Fantasies and Reality.", "\"Honi led the charge about the UR being sexist and put posters up all over the university.\"", "\"One of the useful things as a student journalist were those pieces that I got to do where I was interrogating things that were happening on Union Board.", "So even though I don't presently work as a political journalist, I think that the kind of observation reporting I got to do on those machinations is something that you can really only do on campus when you're that age, because that's the political environment that you have intimate exposure to.", "I learnt some useful lessons about reporting from doing those stories.\"", "In the face of funding cuts arising from the introduction of voluntary student unionism, the UR was effectively wound up in 2005.", "The Daily Bull, formerly a newsletter advertising the services and events provided by the USU, was rebranded as BULL Magazine, replacing the UR as the union's flagship publication.", "While it seems clear that BULL was subject to greater Union oversight than its predecessor, the extent to which this compromised the editorial independence of the publication has perhaps been overstated.", "Though a USU representative subedited every article and sat in on editorial meetings, the role was described by one editor as \"always pretty administrative\"; it was about keeping track of pitches and articles.", "From 2012 to May 2015, the editorial liaison was USU Marketing and Communications Manager Louisa Stylian.", "\"She provided quite a bit of editorial feedback, and that's actually something I found hugely helpful.", "I thought she had a really strong sense of what worked well in the mag,\" says John Rowley, who edited BULL in 2013.", "\"I felt like she was more of an editorial mentor than a voice for the USU.\"", "Two editors cite instances where articles didn't make it to print because of their critical stances on the Union.", "Alex McKinnon, who edited BULL in 2011 and has since gone on to be assistant editor of popular news website Junkee, remembers:", "\"Someone pitched to me the idea of comparing food prices at Union outlets to prices off campus, which I thought was a really good idea.", "And it didn't get through, I mean as you can imagine the markup on things sold at campus outlets would be quite high.\"", "Another editor states that, \"we didn't want to bite the hand that fed us.", "I always saw working on BULL as similar to working in the real world\u2014where someone else subedits your work and your publication has marketing agendas.\"", "Prior to this year, much of the publication's design was outsourced to the Union's Sales and Marketing Department, whose conception of the paper seemed to differ drastically from the students'.", "\"There was a really intelligent feature about people's apparent progressivism in racial politics\u2026 yet their refusal to sleep with people that don't look like them in their sexual lives,\" recalls Eleanor Gordon-Smith.", "\"And the cover was a penis wearing a KKK hood.\"", "While noting that the fuzzy chain of command made it difficult to challenge such decisions, Gordon-Smith emphasises that any issues of editorial autonomy fell squarely at the feet of board directors, \"rather than some graphic designer who's just doing their job\".", "The overall impact of the USU's proposed media alternative on the independence and viability of student publications is mixed.", "Stylian declined to be interviewed for this article.", "However, in a Facebook comment, she decried the board's failure to consult with the current editorial team, writing \"rest assured I would have fought for you\".", "A new section of the Union's website will be devoted to multimedia news and campus culture coverage, with two part-time editors being paid an hourly rate in line with the applicable workplace award agreement.", "Contributors will be paid a fixed rate.", "The decision to increase remuneration for student journalists has been met with near universal praise.", "It is an uncomfortable truth that, generally speaking, only those with the luxury of 12-hour timetables and considerable financial support from their families are able to undertake editorial work for an effective hourly rate of less than $1.", "\"BULL has been a place where a lot of many dedicated talented people get to cut their teeth in a pseudo-professional environment,\" says Gordon-Smith.", "\"So I think recognising that and leaning in to it, for instance by paying people, is a really good way to make sure it keeps doing that.\"", "USU Board Director Ed McMahon told Honi that an editorial policy will be drafted by a working party chaired by elected Directors, and that the student editors will be in charge of the broad editorial vision of the site.", "That said, several students have expressed concerns that paying contributors may give the USU a bit too much editorial power in terms of the content students may be incentivised to produce.", "Much of BULL's content, such as photojournalism and long-form features, is particularly suited to the production cycle of a monthly print publication.", "It is unclear how much continuity will exist between BULL and the new site.", "The shift to an exclusively digital platform, and salaried rather than stipended positions, suggests an attempt by the USU to inject a sense of professionalism into its publications programs.", "The impact of this shift on the relatively radical institution of student journalism is, at best, questionable.", "As McKinnon observes, \"student journalists have more of a capacity to be feral than they would if they were writing for more respectable publications.\"", "Filed under:", "#### Through steel doors: Wom*n at odds with Australia's prison system", "By Nell O'Grady and Liam

\"people knew what the show was,\" executive producer Joshua Safran said.", "It was not long before packs of paparazzi were stalking the set, not dissimilar from the way in which \"Gossip Girl\" and

little S.U.V. at the time and I had it parked out front of our location at the school.", "There were just so many fans everywhere, and when we wrapped at the end of the day, there were handprints all

different perspective now, I never really got used to it. . . .", "I'm a private person and I don't like being the center of attention.\"", "Meester was somewhat flippant about the initial fan attention: \"I think they were mostly there for the guys.\"", "While Sex and the City had blazed the trail for a New York-based show that enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the worlds of fashion and commerce, Gossip Girl set trends for the coveted 18 to 34 demographic in a particularly emphatic way.", "\"It was very clear from the beginning that we wanted to editorialize television and give it this high-fashion, international flair,\" costume designer Eric Daman explained.", "Savage said, \"We talked about how the show, on the one hand, is telling this fictional story about these

involved purple suits, patterned handkerchiefs, and bowler hats\u2014had a profound impact on the marketplace, as well.", "\"I think because he was a Brit and had a different understanding of clothing

told me, and a couple of other guys have told me this, too, that they used to watch the show because it was a great way in with the ladies.\"", "While the tabloids may have desperately hoped for some Lively-Meester on-set friction, this, by all first-hand accounts from those involved with the show, was not the case\u2014though, god knows, that did not stop the tabloids from conjuring such tales.", "\"It's funny,\" Trachtenberg said, \"Because when we were filming, there was, 'Leighton hates Blake, Blake hates Leighton, everyone hates Blake, everyone hates Leighton, everyone hates Chace,' and

and she would be like, 'I'm doing this thing tonight.", "Have you been to this restaurant?'", "Leighton was very removed and very quiet, and, after her scenes were done, she would wander the stage.", "I had this image of her just in these gorgeous dresses with a book in her hand, sort of a little bit out of focus out in the corners.\"", "But even though they may have had different demeanors, the two got along just fine on set: \"Blake and Leighton were not friends.", "They were friendly, but they were not friends like Serena and Blair.", "Yet the second they'd be on set together, it's as if they were.\"", "Lively's life ended up mirroring and then eclipsing that of Serena, the character she was playing.", "\"It was funny,\" Schwartz said, \"When we first started talking to Blake, it was

the world economy, but also for the economics profession.", "The status of the field had never been higher than in the two decades preceding the crisis, during what Ben Bernanke and others called the Great Moderation.", "Inflation and macroeconomic volatility seemed to be under control, and total national income was growing at an almost steady rate (the fact that total debt was growing even faster was less remarked upon).", "In 2002, Alan Greenspan received an honorary knighthood from the Queen for 'his outstanding contribution to global economic stability'.", "The following year, Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, famous for his theory of 'rational expectations', told his audience: 'My thesis in this lecture is that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.", "'With its firm grounding in mathematical rigour", ", economics was the undisputed queen of the social sciences.", "##### Get Evonomics in your inbox", "Economists were therefore more than a little surprised by what jurist and economist Richard Posner \u2013 author of books including the aptly-named A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression \u2013 inventories as 'the bursting of the housing bubble (they didn't know it was a bubble), the ensuing banking collapse, the stock market crash, the sharp decline in output and employment, the global scope of the crisis, and the onset of deflation in the late fall of 2008 that created fears of a depression comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s'.", "According to James Heckman from the University of Chicago, 'Everybody here was blindsided by the magnitude of what happened.", "But it wasn't just here.", "The entire profession was blindsided.'", "Indeed, the crisis came as a traumatic event that left mainstream economists in what Greenspan called 'a state of shocked disbelief'.", "Models which were based on assumptions of stability, equilibrium and efficiency were of little use when markets were cratering, real estate was sinking into the mud, and oil and food were spiking.", "And since that time, economists have been working their way slowly and painfully through the different stages or aspects of the grief process, as they realise that their elegant models not only failed to predict the crisis, but also helped to create it.", "When Economyths first came out, most economists were in a state of denial \u2013 especially those at the top of the profession.", "Future laureate Tom Sargent said in a 2010 interview \"It is just wrong to say that this financial crisis caught modern macroeconomists by surprise.\"", "(No mention of whether the non-modern macroeconomists saw it coming too.)", "Laureate Robert Lucas preferred to see the unpredictability as a natural result of future laureate Eugene Fama's efficient market hypothesis (though as Posner notes, that didn't stop him from predicting, shortly after Lehman's collapse, that the crisis would soon go away).Fama", "agreed that the efficient market hypothesis 'did quite well in this episode'.", "The Nobel committee apparently agreed too.", "As reality sank in, economists soon began lashing out in anger at anyone who dared criticise their field, including yours truly (I'm going to talk about this because it seems to be quite a general problem).", "At Canada's top-ranked economics blog Worthwhile Canadian Initiative, for example, a group of prominent academics, including regular contributors to national publications (Globe and Mail, National Post, Maclean's, Literary Review of Canada, etc.),shared their professional thoughts about the book online.", "Descriptors used included idiotic, ignorant, intellectually lazy, juvenile, random, rubbish, semi-articulated, and 'sort of like Malcolm Gladwell without the insight' \u2013 ouch.", "Someone even compared me to a climate change denier (not uncommon, as it turns out).", "One commenter described the online book burning as part of a widely-deployed 'shoot the messenger' strategy against critics.", "Which is fine \u2013 we give as good as we get, and at least they don't grade us.", "But what was interesting about their discussion was the way these academics, who hailed from top universities such as British Columbia, Carleton, Laval, and so on, managed to maintain the illusion that they were being incredibly tolerant and open to criticism.", "As one put it, 'Economists welcome criticism.", "In the academy, we are well-known, if not infamous, for being direct, abrupt, and rude in criticizing each other (and others).", "There is a very healthy discussion about methodology.", "Bring it on.'", "But they confused academic bickering with genuine criticism from people who share none of their biases.", "The site linked to an even more vituperative blog review by an economics professor at the University of Victoria who of course took pains to say that economics 'benefits from criticism', as long as it's the right type, a topic we discuss further below.", "(Fortunately I was spared the electronic 'viruses and hate mail' which have apparently afflicted other critics of mainstream economics.)", "And that was about it for thoughtful response from the country's economics establishment, at least until former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada William White (now at OECD) \u2013 one of the few people who warned of the financial crisis \u2013 cited the paperback edition as a Bloomberg Best Book of 2013, perhaps out of sympathy.", "Let's make a deal", "As anger started to burn out, the next stage of the drawn-out and generally exhausting grief process involved bargaining: both with the future \u2013 perhaps we can put things right \u2013 and in a kind of retroactive bargaining with the past, saying that the event would not have occurred if only something had been done differently.", "One common argument, anticipated in the book's introductory chapter, was that there is nothing wrong with economics per se, the problem is one of poor communication: the field's critics just don't understand the full rich diversity of economic thought, and are attacking a simplified caricature.", "A good illustration of this approach was the 2015 book Economics Rules by Dani Rodrik from Harvard.", "Echoing Lionel Robbins \u2013 who called economic man an 'expository device' in 1932 \u2013 Rodrick explains that the reason student groups such as the Post-Crash Economics Society are frustrated is that introductory economics courses offer only a pared down version of the theory and give 'little sense of the diversity of conclusions in economics'.", "Also most economists are poor at presenting their arguments to the public, because they 'see themselves as scientists and researchers whose job it is to write academic papers'.", "Rodrik does note the existence of a 'guild mentality' in economics which 'renders the profession insular and immune to outside criticism', and observes in a couple of places that 'Only card-carrying members of the profession are viewed as legitimate participants in economic debates'.", "Yet later he cites the influence of behavioural psychologists and so on to conclude that 'the view of economics as an insular, inbred discipline closed to outside influence is more caricature than reality'.", "(Pardon?)", "The overall impression is one of bemusement at all the fuss.", "After making a number of good points about models, the book concludes with 'Ten Commandments' (aka 'bargaining points') for economists, and ten for non-economists.", "Some of these are very sensible \u2013 #3 from the latter list, for example, says: 'Analysis requires simplicity; beware of incoherence that passes itself off as complexity.'", "Others are versions of common defences against critics, e.g. #9: 'If you think all economists think alike, attend one of their seminars', and #10: 'If you think economists are especially rude to noneconomists, attend one of their seminars.'", "These are surely well-meant and sound fairly innocuous, unless you're afraid of economics seminars, but they come up all the time in different guises and it's worth inspecting them a little more closely.", "The first is a polite variation of the 'caricature' or 'straw man' argument, implying that economics is far more diverse and complicated than it appears to an outsider.", "However, the fact that economists do not agree on every point does not somehow innoculate the field against criticism; and the claim or implication that non-economists don't fully understand the subject, and need to attend a seminar or take a course to appreciate its mysteries, often boils down to a debating or avoidance tactic (and obviously doesn't apply to the increasing number of critics from within the field's own ranks).", "It also leads to the catch-22, perfectly expressed in a generally glowing 2017 review of Rodrik's 'marvelous book' by economist and game theory expert Ariel Rubinstein, published in the Journal of Economic Literature, that 'One needs to be an outsider to criticize Economics but one needs to be an economist to do it sufficiently well so as not to be drawn astray by stereotypes', which doesn't seem to leave many people.", "Apparently Rodrik qualifies, despite or because of the fact that he 'belongs to the elite of the Economics academic establishment'.", "Commandment/bargaining point #10, meanwhile, echoes the idea, also expressed above, that rudeness between economists is evidence of a 'very healthy discussion about methodology'.", "I'm assuming this doesn't include hate mail.", "Five things \u2026", "First, the main objection to the arguments made by economists concerns not the style, but the content.", "Second: as seen below, economists are not rude at all when it comes to questioning their leaders \u2013 in fact obsequious deference would seem to be a better description.", "Third: lack of civility (at least in itself) is not an indicator of healthy scientific debate, in the academy or in the playground.", "I'd say that advertising it probably reflects more an anxiety about appearing robustly scientific.", "Fourth: in his 2006 book The Trouble With Physics, physicist Lee Smolin notes that string theorists cultivate a 'brash, aggressive, and competitive atmosphere', though he doesn't see it as an advantage.", "He also detects a 'blatant prejudice' against hiring women.", "Could these be related \u2013 and could macho posturing be a similar problem in economics?", "According to one article, by economist Miles Kimball and an untenured female economist who didn't want to be identified in case it hurt her career, some male economists 'may not even realize all the ways they routinely put others down \u2013 especially those in vulnerable positions who dare not strike back'.", "Finally, and related, rudeness might be fine between equals, but one of the functions of social graces is to help deal with asymmetrical power relationships, of the sort encountered in economics departments.", "A 2015 investigation at the University of Manitoba, for example, concluded that while the department head, an orthodox economist, had insisted 'that he was committed to maintaining diversity', his subsequent actions resulted in a change of climate that had the opposite effect.", "This ultimately led among other things to 'a violation of academic freedom when orthodox members of the department behaved in ways that discriminated against doctoral students being supervised by heterodox economists'.", "According to one professor there was 'serious bullying going on' including threats to interfere with the tenure process.", "No wonder the students are calling for revolt (they're so rude).", "Economic depression", "It therefore comes as something of a relief to us critics that some economists at least may be proceeding to the penultimate, more passive stage of the grief process, depression.", "Evidence is provided by a paper by Paul Romer, 'The Trouble With Macroeconomics' (he had also been reading Smolin's book, hence the title), a 2016 preprint of which caused a considerable stir in economics circles.", "Sounding almost Economyths-like in style, the first sentence of the abstract announces that 'For more than three decades, macroeconomics has gone backwards'.", "It goes on to describe the author's 'pessimistic assessment of regression into pseudoscience' and mention the 'serious failure' of top economists.", "Decidedly non-upbeat section titles include 'Post-Real Models', 'Loyalty Can Corrode The Norms of Science', 'Back to Square One', and 'The Trouble Ahead For All of Economics'.", "No concrete solutions are proposed for what sounds, to an outsider, like a rather dysfunctional state of affairs.", "In the same way that elegant but unfalsifiable string theory has, as Smolin showed, taken over high-energy physics, so mainstream economics has increasingly emphasised elegant but unfalsifiable mathematical models over experimental reality.", "Most of the parameters in the models cannot be determined from observations, but are simply made up to give the desired answers.", "Events such as crashes are assumed to be caused by external shocks, rather than internal dynamics.", "The models can't make sense out of even basic things like monetary policy, which according to theory \u2013 since money plays no significant role in these models \u2013 should have little or no effect.", "However, the problems are as much sociological as they are mathematical.", "Just as string theory is characterised by what Smolin described as 'groupthink' about the correct way to approach problems, so some economists see it as 'an extremely serious violation of some honor code for anyone to criticize openly a revered authority figure \u2026", "neither facts that are false, nor predictions that are wrong, nor models that make no sense matter enough to worry about'.", "Romer, who is now chief economist at the World Bank, notes that he sees himself more as a practitioner rather than an academic, so feels free to speak out and tell it like it is, but many people are afraid to criticise a 'revered leader' because of the 'unpleasant reaction' that it may evoke.", "He relates a story of running into a colleague who was so angry with him for criticising a paper by Robert Lucas that 'at first he could not speak.", "Eventually, he told me, \"You are killing Bob.\"'", "Yikes.", "So much for that self-image of economists being open to criticism.", "In fact Romer says he was inspired to write the paper after seeing a documentary about the Church of Scientology.", "Paul Mason observed in The Guardian that Romer's paper is important because he is not an outsider or a rebel, but 'a doyen of the profession, and from the heart of the US academic mainstream'.", "As Bloomberg commented, 'along came one of the leading practitioners of his generation, to say that the skeptics were onto something'.", "Which, speaking as one such sceptic, is certainly appreciated.", "In fact in some respects Romer probably goes further \u2013 even I didn't sum an economic argument up as: 'Assume A, assume B, \u2026 blah blah blah \u2026", "And so we have proven that P is true.'", "However, while it is refreshing that some in the mainstream are facing up to these problems, and Romer's paper is written with great courage, a dose of dark humour, and an obvious concern for the state of economics, there is in fact little acknowledgement that these issues have long been debated and solutions proposed outside of the mainstream; and as argued in this book, it is exactly this deafness to other voices which is at the root of the 'trouble with economics', and the reason it has taken so long to confront the fact that there might be a serious problem, let alone actually do something about it.", "The path to acceptance", "Of course, depression is a state of mind that involves turning inwards.", "But for an area as insular as mainstream economics, the final stage of the grief process \u2013 acceptance \u2013 will only come when the field finally gets over itself and opens up to new ideas \u2013 or even the old ideas that have been there all along.", "This may be beginning to happen.", "In 2017 for example the UK's Economic and Social Research Council announced that it intended to set up a network with its remit being to 'revolutionise' the field of economics: 'It will be led by a team of 25 world leading experts taken not only from different branches of economics, but also from psychology, anthropology, sociology, neuroscience, economic history, political science, biology and physics.'", "Perhaps those experts can answer some of the questions we posed for them back in the original 2010 edition of Economyths.", "As seen in the revised edition, ideas from areas such as complexity science and data analysis are starting to sink in and have an effect.", "And some high-profile economists are having a go at new approaches.", "Joseph Stiglitz, for example, recently contributed to a paper that uses an agent-based model to account for 'the complex adaptive nature of economic systems, and the implications of money endogeneity' (i.e. the fact that money is produced by banks).", "##### Get Evonomics in your inbox", "But one thing that mainstream economists won't go near \u2013 it doesn't fit with the models \u2013 is the idea that economists might not be quite so impartial, objective and unbiased as they appear.", "Rodrik, for example, notes that leading economists had bought into the dominant efficient market paradigm which saw markets 'not only as inherently efficient and stable, but also as self-disciplining', and that this 'legitimized and enabled a great wave of financial deregulation that set the stage for the crisis'.", "He describes it as 'curious' that other models were not used.", "But why would they make that particular choice?", "Why were other models, such as Minsky's model of the credit cycle, repressed?", "And did economists buy in or sell out?", "The field of economics has an unhealthily close dependency relationship with the financial sector, which may just have clouded its judgement.", "Instead of acting out against critics in a way that embarrasses the profession, or ignoring those who want to help, it's time for mainstream economists to relax the defences and open up a little.", "A first step is to untangle those institutional effects and other motivations that have shaped their field and which continue to resist change.", "I'm sure there are plenty of sociologists and psychologists (even grief

Rock Band.", "There are many ways you can get to see the youthful Paul McCartney these days \u2013 YouTube, BBC documentaries, the short films that come with the Beatles' newly remastered CDs \u2013 but the best way is the Paul McCartney Soundcheck Package.", "McCartney demonstrated this a few weeks ago at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox.", "It was 4pm, and there were about 80 people in the stadium.", "A few of these were lighting and sound engineers, but most were competition winners from local radio stations and fans who had paid extra for a VIP experience.", "McCartney smiled a lot as he played songs from Hamburg (Matchbox, Honey Don't), songs from the Cavern (All My Loving), songs from Top of the Pops (C Moon, Let 'Em In) and songs from his schooldays (Leaning on a Lamppost).", "The years fell away, and his performance was staggeringly good.", "A woman in our tiny gathering unfurled a multicoloured sign which read, \"Please can you sign my Hofner?\", but McCartney was far too busy having fun.", "Before he sang Leaning on a Lamppost, he explained that George Harrison had given him his ukulele, and before he left the stage he said: \"This is a new one\" as he began singing Yesterday.", "When it was over he had a little chat with his band and security men, and wandered around.", "Catering staff said: \"How ya doin', Sir Paul?\" as he passed, and he

under him on a sofa.", "His dyed brown hair was not as unnerving in reality as it can appear in photographs.", "The trailer looked like a Middle Eastern souk \u2013 rugs on the walls, rich embroidery, sweet candles burning on low tables.", "I told him how much I had enjoyed the previous evening's show (the first of two nights at the same venue), and he said that he was aware he had found his groove again.", "McCartney is 67, and his creativity and thumbs-up enthusiasm continue to surpass all reasonable expectations, but he learned long ago to face universal truths.", "Last night's concert had been a mixture of very popular music from half a century, but it was clear that the one thing his fans loved above everything else was songs by the Beatles.", "They whooped during a few Wings numbers

Boston Globe that week, \"It's like a comedian.", "You can tell any joke you want, but the ones that they laugh at are probably the ones you should keep in the act.\"", "There may be several

it.", "Now a player may not only hear the youthful McCartney, but become him.", "And when he or she becomes bored with Paul, there's always John, George or Ringo.", "In this way, the adventure of pop music is being reinvented.", "\"We've made the Beatles music,\" says McCartney as he sips his tea.", "\"It's a body of work.", "That's it for us \u2013 it's done.", "But then what happens is that somebody will come up with a suggestion\u2026\"", "The suggestion for a videogame came from George Harrison's son Dhani in the winter of 2006, when he met the head of MTV on holiday in the Caribbean.", "MTV had just bought Harmonix, the leading music videogames company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.", "\"So we go, 'What is it? Why?'\" McCartney continues.", "\"Because one thing we don't want to do is just do naff ideas.\"", "McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono (known collectively and disconcertingly as \"the Shareholders\") began to meet people from Harmonix the following year, and McCartney remembers a meeting at Abbey Road in the spring of 2007 in which Harmonix staff demonstrated what they had done for veteran rockers Metallica.", "There were \"a couple of grown-ups standing looking very foolish with these little plastic guitars playing to a screen\", he says.", "\"And we're going, 'Yeah, all right\u2026 It just looks like a really bad band.'", "They said: 'We really can do a great one with the Beatles, and we'll show you.'", "So Ringo and I got a bit intrigued.", "They said: 'Look, the thing is, if we get it right, these things are very, very popular.'", "And we go, 'Yeah, well, we know, because our kids and the young people we know do it.'\"", "McCartney's scepticism gently lifted.", "\"The scepticism is in order not to make a terrible mistake,\" he explained.", "\"We go, 'no, no,' and we're really down on it, and they've really got to prove themselves.", "We won't go, 'Oh, that's nice\u2026 go on boys, you just do it.'", "We guard the flame a bit.", "But then they did come back one day and they had something.", "They were playing our songs, they had some visuals that were half-working, and the penny dropped.", "We went, 'You know what? This could be pretty cool.'\"", "The Beatles: Rock Band works on the same principles as other interactive music games.", "You insert a disc into a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 or Wii console, you strap on a replica guitar or sit at plastic drums, and you play along to a popular song on the television screen.", "The song is programmed to respond to your performance: the more tunefully you sing, or the more accurately you press the buttons on the fretboard and hit the drums, the more points you get.", "The screen displays not only the lyrics, but a long sequence of cues to tell you when to hit or strum, with the coloured notes on the screen corresponding to buttons on your guitar.", "It is the digital version of the pub or campfire singalong, the 21st-century upgrade of the Victorian family parlour concert.", "If you play well, you get mellifluous music that sounds like your heroes.", "If you sing out of tune, your friends may walk out on you.", "The Beatles: Rock Band takes things further.", "There are 45 songs to choose from, soon to be augmented by downloadable albums (in the following months you can get complete versions of Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper's and Rubber Soul).", "There are vocal harmonies, a complex innovation.", "There is very lovely animation that plays before the music begins and in the background after you start playing.", "There are six venues at which the songs are played (Cavern Club, Ed Sullivan Theatre, Shea Stadium, Budokan, Abbey Road and the Apple Corps Savile Row Rooftop).", "There is an elaborate system of gathering points to unlock rare audio and visual material from the Apple archives.", "And then there is the significant fact that the Beatles have never involved themselves in anything like this before.", "\"They've done it very respectfully, and so they should,\" McCartney tells me.", "\"Not just because you should respect the Beatles, but mainly because there are a lot of people out there who are going to notice if you don't", "I ask McCartney whether he's played it yet.", "\"I haven't, actually.", "I'm kind of, you know, looking forward to playing it.", "My excuse is, I play guitar.", "I was on the real record.", "So the idea of pushing buttons and things in time is kind of slightly intriguing for me, but it's actually more interesting to do a show like this\u2026\"", "He motions to the stage beyond his trailer, where his support band MGMT are playing to a swelling audience.", "I wonder what John and George would have made of The Beatles: Rock Band.", "\"I think they would have been amused,\" McCartney says.", "\"I think they would have seen the point of it.", "For us, let's remember that the central thing is our music is getting played.", "That's the bottom line.", "I'm sure John and George would have thought, 'Hey, what a clever idea.'\"", "Two miles from McCartney's show, the people who made the game are talking it up with pride and amazement.", "Harmonix is on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, just down the road from Harvard.", "The office sits between a pharmacy and a Get in Shape For Women studio, a series of rooms that resembles something closer to a student dorm than a company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars.", "(MTV bought Harmonix in 2006 for $175m, but has since paid almost $500m in additional bonuses.)", "In one of the rooms, decorated with a large framed poster of the Beatles, Alex Rigopulos, the co-founder, and Paul DeGooyer, senior vice president of MTV's games division, are discussing their hopes for what may be their most lucrative game to date.", "\"Everyone knows of the Beatles,\" Rigopulos says, \"but there's this whole generation for whom the music isn't personal, it isn't close to them.", "And for that younger audience we're delivering this incredible music in the most impactful way imaginable.", "In a way, it's a relaunch.\"", "Rigopulos and DeGooyer are aware of their coup: now that the biggest band of all have entered the arena, it has not only created a whole new series of marketing possibilities, but has legitimised their industry.", "It marks the precise point at which music videogames come of age.", "Harmonix began in 1995 as a concept at MIT's Media Lab.", "Its first clients were theme parks, and it entered the domestic market with a computer mouse that could also serve as a musical instrument on primitive games.", "Rock Band was only launched at the end of 2007, but already its retail sales in north America have exceeded $1bn, and gamers have downloaded more than 40 million songs for $1.99 each.", "As the company's co-founder Eran Egozy said recently, the delivery of rock music has just entered a new phase.", "There was vinyl, the cassette, the CD, digital downloads and now there is the downloadable digital interactive computer track.", "\"It's a launching point for how we see the future of music evolving.\"", "Harmonix has competition.", "Guitar Hero, made by Activision but originally developed by Harmonix, was launched in 2005 and has since sold more than 25 million copies, making it the market leader.", "But with the Beatles in its stable, Harmonix believes it has pulled off the ultimate coup.", "Songs by the Rolling Stones and the Who were already on Rock Band, but neither of those bands were controlled by the byzantine structure that is Apple Corps Ltd, the company that has handled all of the Beatles' creative activity since 1968.", "But Apple has always had a canny eye for the innovative and the lucrative, and a neat way of relaunching the Beatles for each new generation (the last time it was the exhaustive Anthology project in 1995).", "The main problem was not the concept but the technicalities.", "\"Apple said to us, 'We don't even want to talk about this any more unless you come up with a solution to separating out some of the earlier songs,'\" DeGooyer remembers.", "Rock Band requires each of the main instruments to be played in isolation, but on the Beatles early hits the drums and guitars would often be recorded on the same piece of tape.", "Dhani Harrison believed that the CIA would have some sort of technology to separate them, but in the end a solution was proffered by a company in Cambridge, England, called Cedar.", "There was also the problem of security.", "Apple would not permit the Beatles' master recordings to leave the studio vaults, much less travel to Boston, so once the tracks had been separated out they then had to be encrypted.", "In the summer of 2007, Harmonix received five songs to play with: I Want to Hold Your Hand, Helter Skelter, Taxman, Revolution and Here Comes the Sun.", "The plan was for Harmonix to show how the game might work, and to conceive a rough idea of how an animated Beatles might look on screen.", "The songs came with instructions.", "\"Apple gave us some guidelines to stick to,\" says Josh Randall, Harmonix's creative director.", "\"They said it needs to feel analogue, it needs to feel British, and even though it's a videogame, it shouldn't feel computery.", "But we should also try to make something new \u2013 not just go back and rehash the old stuff.\"", "In the end, the visual team produced a presentation based around Day Tripper, which was the first the Beatles saw of the game when they gathered at Abbey Road in summer 2008.", "\"From each of them there were just tons and tons of ideas,\" says Rigopulos.", "\"They said: 'Oh, you could do this, you could do that, you could do this", "\u2026'", "\"We did get very hands-on,\" McCartney says.", "\"We said: 'Show us everything \u2013 how does it work?'", "They said: 'If you attain a degree of efficiency you'll then get points, and your prize will be trivia facts about the Beatles.'", "I said: 'Oh great \u2013 show us them.'", "So they showed me one and I went, 'Oh, that's wrong.'", "It was the first one up.", "\"Some things you just do 'em: somebody's doing a book or something \u2013 we'll help them, but it's not our responsibility.", "But this is going to go out in our name, so we really have to be careful.\"", "According to Rigopulos, McCartney asked a lot of pointed questions.", "\"He wasn't aloof at all.", "He really did care about accuracy.", "There were some ideas we had about mixing and matching times and places that intentionally disregarded historical accuracy, and he put his stake in the ground.", "We said: 'Maybe the rooftop concert can have songs performed that actually you guys didn't perform on the rooftop.'", "And he said: 'No.", "There are some things we can play with, but some aspects of the design we should be true to.'\"", "In the game, the Beatles are animated in imaginative ways.", "Given the band's history with Yellow Submarine, this will not be unfamiliar territory for the older player, but it caused a lot of heartache at Harmonix.", "McCartney is a keen fan of modern animation, not least because he watches films with his grandchildren and the five-year-old daughter he shares with Heather Mills.", "He felt that the early work was not hugely impressive.", "\"We said: 'Look, the eyes don't work.'", "They said: 'No, eyes are very hard to do\u2026.'", "Then: 'Wait a minute, John's too wooden\u2026'", "I started to say, 'Look, Shrek's good.", "There's this great thing, Arthur and the Invisibles, the Luc Besson film.'", "So I started to give them things to aim at.\"", "Josh Randall says that all the Beatles and their wives were heavily involved.", "Talking on the phone from Henley-on-Thames, Olivia Harrison will tell me later that she thought there was a problem with the proportions in early drawings of George's face.", "\"I started to look at photos to see where they went wrong.", "I thought they could capture those eyes, and get that little bit of a crooked smile.\"", "She had played the game with Dhani in LA and was eager to have another go in private.", "\"It makes you appreciate music a little deeper.", "We don't have a band, but the music exists, and I don't see any harm in letting people have another way of experiencing it.\"", "It was Yoko Ono who apparently caused the most problems with the game's designers.", "Alex Rigopulos remembers one visit to their office during which Ono reminded them how windy the rooftop concert was, necessitating changes to the band's hair.", "There were other corrections: \"She would tell our animation guys how John would approach the mic, how heavy his eyes would be, giving them quite a hard time.", "But at the end she said to them, 'It's OK \u2013 I'm an artist too.'\"", "From Tokyo, by email, Yoko later responds to my questions.", "\"We, especially Olivia and I, were very caring about how the images of the Beatles were represented, as well as the music,\" she says.", "\"The Harmonix people were keen to involve us.", "I think they were really happy that we wanted to integrate ourselves so much into the project.\"", "She hasn't had time to play the game, but promises to \"explore it properly\" when she finishes promoting her new album.", "\"As a parent myself, I am very aware of the highly educational aspect of this game,\" she says.", "\"It will inspire and encourage the young generation to be intimately involved in music making.", "You can't ask for more.", "It will be another musical revolution created by the Beatles to make our planet a planet of music.\"", "The last key figure in the making of the game was Giles Martin, the son of George Martin.", "His remixing of the Beatles hits for the Love project (the Beatles collaboration with Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas) had earned him the trust of the band, and he acted as the middleman between Apple and Harmonix, helping to select tracks for the game and create new precise endings for songs that had previously faded out.", "He too was initially suspicious of the idea.", "\"I was thinking, 'Am I making a Beatles Zippo lighter or a Beatles plastic tray?'", "I was snooty about it at first \u2013 'Oh God, we're just making a game.'", "There's part of me, being a musician, that wants to say, 'Why don't you go and play a proper guitar and not play a plastic one?'", "But what I do like about it is that it makes us listen to the music again and again, in the way that we used to when we bought albums.", "As opposed to having 3,000 songs on your iPod which you flick through with obsessive button pressing.", "These days we do hear a lot of music, but we don't actually listen to it very often.\"", "Giles Martin told me he was surprised, when he tried to play I Want to Hold Your Hand, at just how complex the bass line was.", "I knew what he meant.", "At the end of my first day at Harmonix, I entered the company's Star Chamber, where the games are tested.", "It is also the room where staff come to relax after a hard day's struggle with Ringo's cymbal crashes and George's eyelids.", "Shortly before I was joined by publicity and other staff for a \"concert\", I picked up a replica of McCartney's Hofner bass propped up on a leather sofa.", "This had been designed on a slightly reduced scale by Matthew Reineck, who also makes real guitars.", "The Hofner and the scaled-down models of Lennon's Rickenbacker, Harrison's Gretsch and Ringo's Ludwig drums were plastic, but they felt OK in the hand.", "Reineck explained that McCartney's bass had been made with great attention to detail (Hofner had supplied a special sample of the wood grain), but there were also variations.", "Unlike the original, the guitar was designed for a right-handed player, and it came with a \"whammy bar\" to enable nice sustain effects and ensure \"backwards compatibility\" with other Rock Band games.", "\"McCartney reviewed it halfway through the design process,\" Reineck said, \"and he didn't have an issue with it.\"", "The Hofner will come bundled in a big box with Ringo's drums and a microphone with stand, and will retail for \u00a3180.", "The Rickenbacker and the Gretsch will each cost \u00a390, while the game just on its own (requiring the use of older Rock Band instruments) will cost either \u00a340 or \u00a350 depending on the console.", "As Reineck was talking, various people arrived in the room and strapped on their wireless guitars.", "One of them inserted a disk in the machine, and apologised for a slight technical glitch: the Rickenbacker had run out of batteries, a dilemma the Fab Four had rarely encountered.", "I was surprised how much visual information is displayed on the screen all at once \u2013 it was like a musical satnav.", "It helps if you have a big TV; in fact, it is hard to see how the game could have existed before we all went mad for massive flat screens.", "I was asked what song I fancied and I plumped for Sgt Pepper's, but as a singer.", "One man took pity on me and set the difficulty level to Easy.", "(The game has five levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert and No Fail, the latter a sort of training-wheels option to ensure the cloth-eared are not discouraged.)", "The music began, that familiar chugging.", "I began singing \u2013 that familiar awful sound.", "But I was keen, and it was less fraught than regular karaoke (you don't have to be drunk for a start), and I became a part of the act I'd known for all these years.", "I appeared to get the right words at the right time, and when the song ended (this took a while, as of course it segued into With a Little Help From My Friends) the screen showed I had scored 99 out of 100.", "Vaguely preposterous, but I had made my small contribution to unlocking a rare photograph of the Beatles in the studio with information about the first time they all sported moustaches, and once I had enough of these I would unlock some rare audio of the Beatles goading each other about messing up an intro.", "Glowing with success, I had a shot at Get Back.", "Not so good; only 97%; the rare photograph of George Harrison playing sitar on Magical Mystery Tour would have to wait.", "Overall, I wasn't so sure this was a good hobby for a grown man.", "The future of music?", "Others seemed to think so.", "I asked Olivia Harrison what George would have made of it.", "\"I hate to say, but I know I'm his biggest fan and biggest critic, and I'm happy with it.", "I think they did a great job, and if I didn't like it I would feel very uncomfortable.\"", "Yoko told me: \"People are always asking me what John would have thought of our new technology \u2013 email being our standard way of communication now etc.", "He would have loved it all.", "He was always for new ideas to give inspiration and encouragement to the world.", "He would have been excited about the Rock Band concept, and very happy with how the music and the visuals of the Beatles were represented.\"", "Given the likely success of Rock Band and the remastered catalogue, Marty Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV publishing, said: \"The fourth quarter will belong to the Beatles.\"", "Backstage at Fenway Park, Paul McCartney is 90 minutes away from another night on stage.", "He is explaining how the Beatles got their look.", "\"When I was a kid, I went with my parents and my brother to Butlins Holiday Camp at Pwllheli.", "I had a vision\u2026 what do you call it?", "An epiphany.", "I was by the swimming pool, and we were such a funny family, a little bit Alan Bennett.", "From a door in one of the buildings, I see four guys walk out in a line.", "They were all dressed the same.", "They all had grey crew-neck sweaters, tartan twat hats (as we used to call them, like the Kangols everyone wears now), tartan shorts, and a rolled white towel under their arm.", "They just walked, and I thought, 'Holy shit!'", "They were in the talent show.", "Then I went to see them in the talent show, and they wore grey zoot suits, and they were from Gateshead, and they won.", "And I totally remember that.", "So when we came to be the Beatles, I said: 'You know what?' and I told everyone about this epiphany.", "And so we ended up in suits and we all wore the same.\"", "This was an unfamiliar yarn, and I was aware that McCartney had a reputation for reinterpreting history.", "Or perhaps his memory had become sharper as he aged.", "I said that I had always thought the look was Brian Epstein's idea.", "He said: \"I don't think it was.\"", "He explained that the suits may have been Epstein's thing, as it was the only way they could get the better-paid gigs, but McCartney thought the idea of all looking the same was probably his own.", "\"When we showed up at a gig, we would come in like this [regular street clothes], and then we'd get the boots and the suits, and suddenly we were the four-headed monster, and it was a very exciting feeling.", "We'd look at each other \u2013 wow!", "And we'd become more than the sum of the parts.", "We'd become the Beatles.\"", "The show that night was terrific.", "Thirty-five thousand people had an epiphany of their own.", "The concert also marked another Beatles milestone, for as McCartney sang Got to Get You Into My Life, from 1966, the vast screen behind him showed an animated film of the Beatles from 2009.", "\"The pictures you saw there are from this new Beatles Rock Band thing,\" he said.", "His fans clapped and whooped, because they had been presented with a new opportunity, the ability to recreate tonight's event at home.", "Batteries required, unsurpassed creative genius optional.", "## Yesterday's sound today", "\"The idea is to make the Beatles sound as good as they can,\" says Allan Rouse, talking at Abbey Road.", "He is the co-ordinator in charge of the digital remastering of the Beatles' back catalogue.", "This means that the Fabs' 12 albums, plus Magical Mystery Tour, which became part of the core catalogue when the first Beatles CDs were released in 1987, now boast a brighter, fuller sound.", "Some bad edits, dropouts and vocal pops are gone; but the odd cough, John muttering \"fucking hell\" during Hey Jude - this sort of thing remains.", "\"De-noising\" - removing analogue tape hiss - has only been applied to five of a total of 525 minutes worth of music.", "The release of the remastered CDs coincides with the arrival of Rock Band - \"because,\" says Rouse, \"the Beatles are for everyone, not just for people in the past.\"", "Caspar Llewellyn Smith", "## Games

looking at the broader market, the trends that were affecting the market to move towards cloud and software-as-a-service and felt that kind of problems that Phil had had at Facebook were the kinds of problems that everyone was beginning to see and without doubt an opportunity to start a company around it and so we decided to start SignalFx.", "Martin: Karthik, what is your background and how did it prepare you for starting a company?", "Karthik:", "I've been at startups pretty much my entire career, at least, when I started a company that's been startups.", "Right out of college I joined the company called Loudcloud which was in the cloud computing space before cloud computing really existed as a market.", "In fact, we had the name cloud in our name Loudcloud back in 1990/2000.", "I was there for a few years.", "And then I went to VMware and I was there for a long time.", "I started when the company was still relatively small as a startup.", "I got to grow up with the company and see it grow through various stages of growth and by the time I left it was almost a ten thousand-person company.", "So that was a real highlight, being able to be a part of a company from the early days and see it through to become a fairly substantial and significant player in the industry.", "Then, I went to another startup called Delphix for a few years but I always wanted to start my own company.", "When Phil and I started to talk about building SignalFx everything just seemed to click and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to go to realize my dreams of being a founder and build a company of our own", "and so Phil and I decided to start SignalFx.", "Martin:", "Can you shine some light on the first 12 months of starting the business and the operations?", "How was it like?", "Karthik:", "It's actually pretty boring for the most part but our model is a little bit different.", "I mean, every model is unique here in Silicon Valley but Phil and I were able to raise money right away so that the two of us had..", "I think, because we've both been in the Valley for a long time and Phil had a lot of credibility around the technology because he built a similar kind of solution at Facebook, we were able to raise money right away before we hired our team.", "And so we had the luxury of taking a little bit of time to build the right product and do it thoughtfully.", "So from the time we started the company until we launched the company it was almost a full two years.", "So the first year, really a lot of it was, you know, laying the foundation, determining what the technology and architecture was going to look like; recruiting our initial group of engineers, building out the core technology and getting to a point where we could begin to go and recruit beta customers.", "But the first year, it was pretty much all product development.", "Beyond at the very beginning there is the fundraising process, and then once that was done it was pretty much just building.", "Martin: And when did you start talking to initial customers?", "Karthik: Well, we had beta customers \u2013 I think we started our first beta about a year and a half after we started the company, roughly about a year and a half after beginning.", "And I guess the question is how did we find these customers are or what the -?", "Martin: No. Just when did you start looking for them so one and a half year \u2013 ?", "Karthik:", "Yes.", "Well, we wanted our product to be far enough along that we could actually deliver value to customers but we didn't want to wait so long that we would go too far down a path that wasn't necessarily appropriate for the marketplace.", "That is a very fine line to walk.", "We felt we hit that point about a year and a half and where we had enough of the core technology that could actually solve problems for customers who had a big enough pain point in the areas that we were addressing.", "So we found some of these early customers who were willing to invest the time in a young company and be design partners to us and work with us on our beta.", "So, yes, it was about a year and a half after we founded it.", "Martin: What was the customer feedback like?", "Did they say wow this is really awesome or did they say you are on a good track but actually we would like to change this and this in the feature in another way that could solve our pain points more efficiently?", "Karthik:", "I think generally the overall feedback was very positive.", "Since the very first customer has signed up, they loved the product and loved this base they were in.", "There is always feedback and the feedback tends to be in the places that you didn't expect, right?", "So little things that you missed because you think about the product the way that you would use it and then you go to a different organization that has a different model and maybe a different process and or a different way of doing things and you have to sort of adjust it a little bit to help solve their problems in ways that makes sense with their organizations.", "So those were the kinds of things that you have to build small features to help our product integrate better into a customer's environment and address them, scenarios that maybe we haven't thought about.", "But the core concept, the core product, the core value proposition we've never wavered from.", "almost three years ago we thought the value would be, continues to be where most people are getting value today and what people are excited about today.", "It is on the perimeter, there are a number of things that, as you engage with customers you realize that we really need to add these things because it'll make it much easier for customers to use and deploy and get the value out of our products if we have these additional components.", "# BUSINESS MODEL OF SIGNALFX", "Martin: Karthik, can you, please, elaborate a little bit on the value propositions with what type of pitch are you currently targeting your customers?", "Karthik:", "SignalFX is a monitoring service for monitoring application.", "So we are now not focusing on monitoring traditional enterprise apps like a SAP, Oracle.", "There's plenty of companies that have been doing that for the past thirty or forty years.", "But what we do as your building the next generation of new applications.", "If you're moving to a cloud architecture or even if you're running your own data center but you're building a modern application that has micro services or open source or it's just distributed in nature it is a very different challenge monitoring these modern apps versus traditional apps.", "And the big differences are:", "Number one, these applications tend to be updated more frequently.", "Instead of doing one or two updates a year, you have updates that happen once a week or once every couple of weeks.", "Number two, they tend to be more complex applications where it's not just one app running \u2013 one monolithic app running on one machine.", "It tends to be service oriented so you can have multiple services, all communicating with one another.", "So if something goes wrong you have to understand and pinpoint did it go wrong in service A or service B and how does that affect your entire chain of services.", "And then the third thing that is fundamentally different is that apps tend to be distributed.", "So you have because the VMs and containers are so lightweight and so easy to spend up in cloud environment you could have applications that have dozens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of components.", "And so in that world if you have to monitor large complex rapidly changing environment our belief is that the only way you can do that is through analytics.", "And you need to collect a bunch of information across all these different systems, perform real time analytics on it so that you can more practically identify trends and patterns as they emerge in your environment.", "And that's really our specialty.", "SignalFx is \u2013 we solve the monitoring problem but we do it through analytics.", "And so for our customers the benefit that they get is number one they get real-time complete visibility of everything that's happening to their applications.", "So keep in mind most applications these days are living breathing organisms and more and more they are critical to business.", "It's not like in the old days you have some back-office applications that is unavailable for a little while, it's a nuisance to people.", "But today these applications are your business.", "And if you have problems with that it materially impacts your business.", "You want to understand everything that's happening as it's happening.", "So we provide that visibility, we provide very high quality alerting.", "And so instead of getting alerts every time some random component is failing you get alerts when some meaningful trends are happening like significant subset of users in a particular region connecting with a particular device are experiencing larger than normally lengthencies.", "That is something that you care about.", "Those are the sorts of things that we help our customers really understand very, very, very quickly and very effectively.", "Martin: If I as a customer of yours, for example, have a very distributed kind of API system \u2013 how do I set up your SignalFx service?", "Karthik: There are lots of different ways of doing it.", "We have technologies that we provide out of the box.", "We have an open source agent that a lot of our customers use.", "It's one-line demand to get it installed and it collects all of the infrastructure metrics; it collects a bunch of application metrics if you're running open source components.", "If you're running MySQL, Postgresql, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Cassandra, these common open source, the platform will collect metrics from right out of the box and give you a comprehensive analytics and dashboards around it so you can understand what's happening to those.", "For your custom apps or for your APIs you would probably have some of those metrics put into log files and so we have log scrapers that can take those metrics, count them and send them into SignalFx or you can just send metrics directly into SignalFx from your applications.", "Every time an API is called, for example, you can send a metric into SignalFx that measures how long it took to process that request must including the number of dimensions around it, like which customer made that request, what region they are coming from.", "And then once all that data is in SignalFx you can start to slice and dice it in meaningful ways.", "As events are happening in your environment you can see it in SignalFx.", "Martin: Who do your target customers? And how do you basically acquire them?", "Karthik:", "Our target customers \u2013 it's basically anyone building an application who could use SignalFx.", "And there is a lot of application development happening in the technology community obviously.", "And so everyone here is a potential target for us.", "But more and more we see traditional enterprises also investing a lot in software development because\u2026", "As our investors, Marc Andreessen Horowitz likes to say \"Software is eating the world and every company is becoming a software company\" and so as they're investing in new software they also need a system like SignalFx to be able to observe as a software is out there in the wild, the operational characteristics of a software, performance metrics, to understand how the applications are scaling \u2013 all of these things that they need to understand they could use SignalFx to do it.", "The second part of your question \u2013 how do we acquire the customers?", "We are SaaS service, we do all the traditional marketing that you would expect business to do we.", "We have demand generation programs, we have a more concentrated community of buyers today.", "It tends to be operations teams.", "Some people also call them development teams.", "There are conferences where they tend to cluster and so we are present at those conferences.", "We also have a tremendous amount of word-of-moth with our existing customers.", "We have very happy customers and they tell their peers and then they come in and they find that since we've got a lot of inbound people finding us, hearing about us, coming to our website, signing up for a trial.", "We have a free trial.", "It's a very lightweight process.", "Someone can come and sign up, then immediately get value from the product and get a sense of the value they can get from us.", "So it's a very low friction, very easy way to get started.", "It's not a heavyweight sales engagement like classic enterprise software.", "Martin: Are you also using distributional partners like consulting companies?", "Karthik:", "As a young company the most important thing is to understand your own model very well first, I believe.", "So we've only been selling for six months.", "We launched in March.", "We've built our sales scheme.", "It's an exceptional sales scheme.", "We are really understanding all the nuances of our go-to-market motion ourselves but, absolutely, I think over time there's a lot of opportunities to work with distribution partners and services partners.", "But right now our focus is on understanding are own model very, very well before we start engaging with partners.", "Martin: It makes sense.", "Karthik, you said that you are basically is a SaaS model.", "What are the price drivers in your model?", "Karthik:", "The way our product is priced is based on the amount of data that customers send us.", "And we've done a lot of things to make it very fair and easy for customers to control what data they send into SignalFx.", "And the reason we do it this way, in the most traditional monitoring solutions prices are based on the number of servers that you are running.", "Unfortunately, that doesn't work well in the modern cloud environment because first of all these environments tend to be elastic.", "We talk to so many customers that could double or triple the number of VMs in their applications on a daily basis.", "They'll scale up and they'll scale down, pick hours will spike up and then they'll come down.", "So host count is a lot more fluid than it used to be.", "It's not quite as predictable as a metric of usage as it used to be.", "And secondly, not all hosts are graded equal anymore because you have some applications that you really, really care about and you want to collect a ton of data around those and other applications that are not critical and you don't collect as much data.", "And so it's not very fair to price the same for both of those.", "So what our customers do is, they can decide whatever data they want.", "Ultimately the primary cost of the solution like this is data storage, we just charge them on the number of data points that they send in, the data rate.", "The more data they send in, our storage class are higher.", "We have to retain that for our customers, and we tell them okay, there's a higher cost, the higher price.", "The less you send in, the less we have to store, the cheaper it is for the customer.", "It's a very fair model for customers; they can decide what they send, they can decide how they want to send it and they can download them down at a moment's notice.", "Martin:", "Karthik, you said that you are basically doing analytics based on the apps pinpointing where there might be an issue.", "Are you also doing predictive analytics for seeing maybe some patterns between your customers and seeing, there might be an issue for that kind of apps and there is some overlap in the usage of similar apps between some of those customers", "I see an issue rising at one customer therefore I may be predictive, tell another customer there might be an issue coming around \u2013 here is how you should solve it.", "Karthik: We don't do that because of number of reasons.", "Number one, our customers are very sensitive about data privacy, right?", "So we even anonymize, we don't do that \u2013 there is no pattern matching between different customers.", "It's completely isolated; there's no comparison of one customer to another.", "Secondly, I think one of the things that's fundamentally different is that every application is unique.", "And we have a massive fragmentation in a number of applications today compared to twenty years ago.", "Twenty years ago, everyone was running package software, and so you could look at Oracle trends across 10,000 customers.", "But today, Salesforce is very different from Work Day which is very different from Facebook, very different from Google and they are all unique applications that have their unique workload characteristics and unique hardware configurations.", "And so it doesn't make as much sense anymore to do those patterns across customers.", "There could be some benchmarking sorts of things down the road but at this point we're focusing more on giving the tools to the customers, the exploratory tools so they can richly understand their own data and look at the patterns in their own data and draw conclusions from that rather than trying to solve problems from looking at patterns across customers.", "Martin: Karthik, what have been the major obstacles over the last three years and how did you overcome them?", "Karthik:", "Well, I think as with any enterprise business one of biggest question marks is what your market model is going to look like.", "I think that when we started with the company we had a lot of conviction that there was a huge need for a product like what we built.", "And I think that's been validated over and over again, the more we talked to customers and the more we are around in the marketplace.", "I think the big question mark in the early days was what our go to market motion looks like; do we sell more to mid market accounts, enterprise accounts, where is the interest going to be?", "In the early days you have to spend a lot of time experimenting with different accounts.", "For us, it's turned out that there are all sorts of segments.", "We've got some great large customers that are traditional enterprises in large web skill organizations where they're essentially replacing their entire monitoring systems with SignalFx.", "We have midsize customers that move a little bit more quickly.", "And the deal sizes are not quite as big but you know they want to have more of that transaction motion.", "And so we've seen both models and then I think figuring out how to structure our team so that we can best equip both of those segments to be successful, that has been a kind of our biggest learning over the past year.", "And I wouldn't say it's a challenge but I would say that that was a big question mark when we went into our launch \u2013 what kind of go to market motion do we need to build for these different segments?", "Should we focuse more on one or another or gain the opportunity in both?", "And we've certainly seen the customers across the entire spectrum and so designing the go to market organization to support all of those customers has been probably the biggest area of investment for us as a company in the last 6 months.", "Martin: And what type of experience did you do in order to validate your go to market strategy?", "Karthik: With sales it was very easy.", "You see your customers signing up for your service.", "Are they willing to pay you?", "And so the experiments are \u2013 I think you experiment with messaging and you see which message has worked.", "In my experience, one of the things that we did very well is we hired some exceptional people in field who are very thoughtful, listen well, very intelligent.", "They have almost qualities like stem cells; they can adapt and become whatever model we need them to become and it was an incredible luxury to have people like that in the early days because we were able to really listen to customers, observe the patterns that were coming in and be able to figure out, ok, well, this is how we need to design our go to market motion versus assuming that it was going to be one way or another.", "I think we're able to adapt very quickly based on what was on the market.", "Martin: And how did you find those generalists sales people?", "Karthik:", "We interviewed a lot of people and I think we were just fortunate that we found some really high quality individuals who were willing to come and work with us.", "# ADVICE TO ENTREPRENEURS FROM KARTHIK RAU", "Martin: Karhtik, this is your first company that you've started for yourself.", "What type of advice would you share with other people thinking about starting a company?", "Karthik: Lots of things.", "You can spend a lot of time talking about this.", "I think what most of entrepreneurs would say is number one, you have to be very passionate about the idea because it is like a marriage \u2013 you are in it forever.", "You need to be excited about the team that you're starting working with; the co-founder chemistry has to be very, very strong; you have to really love what you're doing whether that's the product, the technology that you are building, or the team that you are building.", "So, I think that's absolutely critical.", "I think another thing that I would suggest to everyone is don't forget to enjoy the journey because I think a lot of people get so focused on \u2013 they are stressed about the outcome.", "That's natural.", "You are always trying to create the best organization that you can, but it's a beautiful journey.", "I think for me Mondays are my best days of the week.", "I get to come in and work with a fantastic group of people.", "Phil and I get to pick who we want to work with every day.", "We get influence it in a really meaningful way, the culture, the values that we care about.", "And that's a really beautiful thing.", "I think you have to stop and smell roses sometimes.", "That's one thing I think a lot of entrepreneurs forget to do.", "I think the third thing I would say is that every company is like a snowflake.", "It's all unique.", "Every company is absolutely unique.", "And people tend to pattern match and you will meet a lot of really smart people who have had great experiences and been very successful who will try to prescribe their approach to your company and everything changes.", "There is always some dimension that's changed.", "It could be the exact same technology and space from ten years ago versus today where markets are fundamentally different today versus 10 years ago.", "Your personalities are going to be different from other personalities, your founding team and culture everything is going to be unique so you really have to understand and introspect very well who are you, what do you do very well, what are your strengths, what are your weaknesses, what does your market truly look like, what's different about the market today versus five years ago, ten years ago and come up with a unique strategy because you are unique, your situations are unique.", "And you can get incredible input and advice from people but all of that input and advice comes with a bias and if you understand that bias you can then tease out the bias and just try to understand which of these things should be applicable to my world and which are not.", "But oftentimes it means you have to make a decision that is a lonely decision because it's based only on your company and what you have to do but it's very, very important that you make that decision on what's best for your company and not based on what's other people telling you.", "I think that's a very important thing to do when starting a company.", "And then I think the last thing I would suggest is from a personality point of view \u2013 I think you have to really, really enjoy the wins a lot more than you get down by the losses.", "Because every company has its ups and downs and as you go through the life cycle of a company early on by its very nature if you're in the market that's a new market that people haven't figured out as the big market yet you're going to have more people not understanding what you do very well understands what you do then someone else who is bigger and has more capacity to fulfill the demand with the market.", "So your timing has to be right from the beginning.", "You grow as the market is growing and that necessarily means that in the early days you're going to have fewer wins but you have to really relish the wins.", "That is everything I would suggest to people.", "Martin: You said that every Monday you are very happy to come to the office and work with great people and shaping the company and culture.", "What do you do to shape the culture of the company?", "Karthik: I think it starts first of all with who you hire.", "Culture, it's not something that you write up on a wall with a few bullet points.", "It has to be embedded in everything you do, every decision you make, every person you hire, what behaviors you embrace and reinforce and which behaviors you try to eliminate.", "I think it starts with the people you hire so you have to be very prescriptive about what are the cultural attributes that you care about.", "When we interview people we always have at least one person do a fit screen culture screen.", "I interview everyone that comes into the company and I'm always the final culture screen.", "And we're very prescriptive about what are the cultural attributes that we look for and that is very, very important.", "We've turned away a lot of people that are incredibly talented individuals but we felt that they didn't map to the kind of company and the culture that we wanted to build.", "So for us there are things like we really care about intellectual curiosity and someone, for example, like engineers that ask questions about the business and our business model are candidates that we really like.", "If there's a very talented engineer that shows no interest in the business, it really sways things to the other.", "Because we want everyone at our company to operate as business owners and we screen for that from the very beginning.", "And similarly on the sale side, when we are interviewing sales people we like them to ask and want to understand product strategy.", "And in that way we get everyone who when they are at the company, they are custodians of the business and they may be wearing a particular hat to be a salesperson or an engineer for their day-to-day jobs, but if they see something that they question there are not afraid to ask a question and then collectively as a team will make better decisions because we've got a variety of perspectives.", "So that's one independent thinking as another.", "Because as a start-up you have to take risks and you have to go against the grain sometimes and you have to make non obvious conclusions and so we really try especially in leadership positions to find people who are creative and will connect the dots in ways that other people don't.", "If we learn interesting things in an interview and we see different perspectives that we haven't seen before that's positive for us.", "There are all of sorts of these things that we try to do to screen for culture.", "So who you hire, the behaviors that you enforce, who you promote into management positions is one of the most important factors in building a culture, because I never would run a company we will see these are the behaviors that are rewarded.", "The behavior of managers is also very significant because that's again what people look at us \u2013 this is what the company values.", "You have to be very careful about who you promote, what behaviors they're displaying to the rest of the company, how you allocate different responsibilities to people, who you get what projects.", "Again it reflects to the rest of the company what qualities do we admire and respect.", "If we have a really big problem that we need to solve and it is very important for the company to solve it and we give these three people the role of solving that problem and it tells the company these are the three that were trusting to solve this big problem and they are obviously the skills that they have that the company really appreciates and respects.", "This isn't just about technical skills.", "It's technical skills, it's interpersonal skills, it's just all of these things become your culture.", "And I think it really starts with the people who you hire, who you promote, who you give certain roles too.", "And then myself and Phil, my co-founder, how we act every day is I think people look to us too, and the things that we value and how we treat people and treat partners and look at the opportunities.", "I think this is something that people look at as an example.", "There are so many different things that are involved in building a culture but I think the key is that you have to keep reinforcing certain tendency and do that across the entire company.", "Martin: Karthik, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.", "It was really the pleasure.", "Karthik: Thank you, Martin, very nice to meet you.", "Martin: Likewise.", "And the next time when you are starting a company you should really focus also in the beginning on the company's culture that you are hiring the right people not only based on the skills but also based on the attitude, because you want to minimize the asshole factor, for example, what do they work and be very curious about what they are working.", "Thank you so much.", "#### Share your thoughts and

Zadan considered the production to be \"one of the profoundly complicated, amazing experiences we\u2019ve ever had\", noting the additional challenges created by the live broadcast. \n Promoted by NBC as a \"three-hour holiday event\", \"The Sound of Music Live!\" was aired as part of a push by NBC to air more live entertainment specials. Among its most popular programs in recent years have been those with live components (such as \"The Voice\" and \"Sunday Night Football\"); NBC's Jennifer Salke believed that the increased level of social network interaction possible in a live broadcast, along with the feeling of being part of an \"event\", would encourage viewers to watch the special live instead of on-demand or from a recording. NBC's previous attempt at event television, \"The Million Second Quiz\", was met with mixed reviews and viewership, but NBC did indicate that Subway's advertising throughout the series brought a higher level of awareness to the brand. The television special was also the first live musical special in almost fifty years on NBC. Retail chain Walmart served as the presenting sponsor for \"The Sound of Music Live!\".

reason is a reduction in lifecycle generation cost to financially outperform coal.", "Another is that well designed NG plants have fewer toxic emissions than other fossil fuels.", "The most important advantage is how NG and renewables complement each other in the overall electricity portfolio.", "The electricity output of renewables is higher up the pecking order in consumption priority than a thermal power plant \u2014 it's called the Merit Order Effect (renewables have a higher demand merit) \u2014 as there is no additional operational cost of paying for the fuel.", "A zero marginal cost of solar or wind energy supply always wins over fuel expenses.", "However, solar and wind are variable sources of electricity that can, at times, produce excess electricity than planned (or vice

administration has tried to revive coal's fortunes for political reasons, but to no avail.", "All sorts of concessions aren't rolling back the years for coal, because of the sheer force of competitive economics.", "It's now more economical to invest in a new renewables plant than prop up a coal dinosaur.", "This month, the US Federal Commission rejected the push to subsidise coal and nuclear for future electricity needs, prompting media headlines like \"Trump's Coal Bailout Is Dead\".", "China's progressive transition to renewables is even more dramatic.", "About a year ago, the Chinese National Energy Administration abruptly cancelled all 103 of its new coal power plant licences totalling 1.2 GW capacity.", "China learnt the hard way that a strategy of green coal power based on supercritical and ultra-supercritical technology had spawned \"white elephants\" in a \"provincial pipe dream\".", "Utilisation rates for coal power were plummeting.", "Independent US research into the Chinese experience came to the conclusion that it's not a good idea to follow the same failing strategy (though obviously the Trump administration wasn't paying attention).", "Renewables and gas were better options, it concluded.", "Aside from worsening air pollution, despite the use of superior coal technology, and the consequent social backlash, the economics didn't work out for China.", "Parochial politics, chasing short-sighted gratification for their own constituencies, drove the Chinese coal rush further into the mire.", "The disappointing outcome is captured in the above graph (see China's Coal-fired Power Capacity Bubble).", "On the other hand, China's experience with solar PV and wind has been as escalating lovefest, not only domestically but in international investment.", "In 2016, China installed 68 GW of renewables nationwide out of a global total of 165 GW (surpassing its 2020 cumulative target well in advance).", "Investments in overseas projects crossed $44 billion last year.", "China is eagerly consolidating its global leadership in renewables, as a consumer, manufacturer and investor.", "The future of coal in India is also in jeopardy.", "Hazardous air pollution, of great peril to the political establishment, has necessitated tighter emissions controls for new coal power plants, spiking the total deployment costs.", "Renewables, both solar and wind, have soundly beaten coal to become the cheapest electricity source in India.", "Two-thirds of India's coal power is now more expensive than renewables.", "Replacing these coal power plants with renewables would save Indian consumers up to $8 billion annually.", "Recent research indicates that further investment in coal will result in India missing its Paris Agreement emissions targets and/or cause a proliferation of stranded assets.", "A stranded asset means a power plant that has to be operationally abandoned before the completion of its planned financial lifetime.", "In contrast, there is little risk of a stranded asset in renewables because the variable operational cost is zero.", "Unsurprisingly, the Indian government is beating a strategic retreat from coal, abandoning a pipeline of 50 GW.", "Coal India, the world's largest coal company that owns 82 percent of India's coal, has been forced into closing down 37 mines.", "Further closures are on the cards to deliver the desired coal-free future.", "The writing on the wall is crystal clear.", "Numerous other examples from Chile to Britain to Australia present similar facts, show trends in the same direction.", "Future electricity portfolios will be dominated by solar, wind and NG.", "Forward-looking economies do not want to become trapped in the past with coal.", "It would be quite foolhardy on the part of Pakistan to go against the tide of the global energy transition, wasting its meagre financial resources on coal.", "Pakistan, like China and India, is a signatory to the Paris climate

660 MW power plant", "While the more savvy energy planners are busy migrating to 21st century electricity portfolios, we seem intent on financing a power supply chain that will become obsolete before the investment fully pays off.", "Although renewables have become cheaper, are cleaner, and save on the scarce, precious resource of freshwater, a trite argument used by die-hard coal advocates is that it's necessary to provide baseload power.", "A few years ago, the CEO of UK's National Grid famously remarked in an interview, \"The concept of baseload is already outdated\", going on to explain that \"the idea of a large baseload generator that runs pretty much all of the time ... just doesn't have as good a fit to the market conditions we expect to see.\"", "Baseload power means the provision of a minimum threshold of power for a sustained period of time.", "Coal power plants are no longer needed for it.", "The diversification of electricity supply to renewables and NG has enabled a more robust paradigm of flexible power generation.", "The minimum threshold is securely and economically taken care of, not to mention the unexpected deviations in demand.", "The old baseload contracts that coal needed for economic profitability are now defunct, incongruous with modern electricity planning.", "An illustration of how the future electricity needs for hot climates like Pakistan, the so-called duck curve of aggregated demand variation in such conditions, can be best served by renewables and NG without the need for any coal:", "The whole point behind sprawling, capital intensive, transmission and distribution networks is taking advantage of diversified electricity sources.", "Flexible power generation has been likened to a musical orchestra, the conductor needs to know what instrument to play at different times to satisfy the tune of demand.", "Solar and wind generation are complementary in terms of their daily and seasonal variation.", "NG chimes in well, coal doesn't.", "Energy storage is also an essential part of the band.", "When a large coal power plant trips, as it will do, a backup energy storage unit of equal power output capacity is needed to quickly compensate for the outage.", "With distributed renewables, any single outage of a solar PV or wind system will not require the same level of backup.", "The geographical distribution of electricity supply, the more renewables the better, reduces such backup costs.", "The backup requirement also kicks in during the downtime of power plants, for periodical maintenance operations.", "The typical guaranteed plant availability of solar PV and wind is over 98-99 percent, while it is around 70-80 percent for coal.", "The operational maintenance of solar PV and wind plants is much simpler than that for coal power, so their scheduled and unexpected downtime is much less.", "Energy storage comes in several varieties.", "Large-scale centralised energy storage can consist of pumped hydro \u2014 the Makran coast offers possible locations \u2014 or compressed air energy storage, perhaps feasible in the abandoned salt mines of Khewra.", "Decentralised energy storage in the form of MW-scale batteries is making rapid advances in cost and ease of installation.", "MW-scale batteries are ideal for storing the cheap electricity of solar and wind, shifting the supply to different times of the day.", "This advancing technology front boosts the case for renewables, accelerates the inevitable obsolescence of coal.", "In countries such as Pakistan, where the transmission and distribution networks are weak and plagued by energy theft, an attractive alternative is the bottom-up electricity infrastructure development of micro-grids.", "These micro-grids can deliver reliable power at various levels e.g. an industrial zone, rural village or metropolitan area.", "Coal power is not suitable for micro-grids because, unlike renewables, it is not modular and incrementally scalable.", "Micro-grid projects rely primarily on renewables and NG from local renewable sources (methane from waste).", "These micro-grids can be set up far more quickly than thermal power plants, and offer an ideal quick fix solution to local load-shedding.", "NATIONAL SECURITY OR FOLLY", "Dumper trucks at the Thar-Block-II mining site", "It's unlikely that the Thar coal power output will be in demand for exports to India.", "The area on the other side of the border is prioritised for India's national solar strategy, and we know the cost of this solar electricity is cheaper than the output price of the proposed Thar coal project.", "We also know that India is phasing out its own reliance on coal power, as it's incompatible with a forward-looking electricity portfolio based mainly on renewables.", "Sustainable electricity at affordable prices for the long run without technical or financial risks, mitigating climate change, optimal use of our land, water management, clean air, and avoiding social discontent that can be politically exploited, are all issues of major national security importance.", "The Thar coal endeavour needlessly creates vulnerabilities in every aspect.", "Energy independence is better secured by renewables than resorting to the Thar coal reserves.", "There is no need for a trade-off between cheap, reliable electricity supply and preserving our natural environment.", "The situation might have been different when the Thar coal project was originally envisaged, but we can surely do better now, learning from the experiences of others and understanding the latest options available with an eye on future developments.", "The Thar coal is best left buried as it is.", "A few may fleetingly benefit from this silly, blighted scheme but it's not worth sacrificing the well-being of the many and national security for it, and it is not worth proving how myopic and self-destructive a nation we have become, easily led astray.", "It would be a grave

He stated \"When I say The Tragically Hip doesn't exist as a performing unit anymore because a key member is gone, I think [fans] understand that. We wouldn't be The Hip without Gord [...] The Hip has played their last note.\" Baker also revealed that Downie had encouraged the group to audition replacement vocalists, but the other members did not seriously consider the idea.

(1.5\u00a0m) in 1880. The shortstop position, which for Adams was located between the infielders and outfielders, was later played in the infield, between second and third base. Dickey Pearce was the first player to field in that area, and his ability to prevent base hits in the formerly unoccupied territory convinced other teams to employ similar tactics. \n The \"Hartford Courant\" points to 1980 as a year when Adams started to gain greater attention for his achievements. A share of the New York Mets was purchased by a publishing company led by Nelson Doubleday Jr. that year, and claims that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839, which are considered flawed by modern researchers, were reported by the media. After the Doubleday reports in 1980, \"The New York Times\" received a letter from the great-great-grandson of Adams that the \"Courant\" said attempted \"to try to set the record straight.\" The newspaper ran the letter in its April 13 issue, and added a 1939 piece by Roger Adams. In 1993, Thorn published research on Adams' contributions in the encyclopedia \"Total Baseball\"."}}

Hershiser's 1984 streak, which was the longest scoreless inning streak of the year, was broken up on July 24 by a home run by two-time NL Most Valuable Player Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves. His streak included a blown save on July 8 against the St. Louis Cardinals and a nine-inning shutout against the Cardinals on July 19. \n Despite an emergency appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened his time to get in shape for the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and a participant in the 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3\u20134 win\u2013loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06.

She had a daughter, Dorothy Helen, born in Philadelphia in 1919. In 1921, when Ashley's Sack was embroidered, Ruth would have been a single mother to a young daughter. Newspaper reports and census records suggest that throughout her life Ruth worked in affluent households in Philadelphia. By 1928, she was well-known in Philadelphia's African American high society, gaining regular mention in the \"Smart Set\" and \"High Society\" pages of the Philadelphia Tribune, the leading African American newspaper. Auslander writes that Ruth \"host[ed] bridge and cocktail parties and [wore] elegant couture.\""}}

Elizabeth's only son, William, died of scarlet fever at the age of nine months.", "She had already had a few short stories published and her husband suggested that she wrote a novel as a distraction from her grief.", "The Gaskells' Manchester was a great cultural and intellectual centre, boasting institutions like the Literary and Philosophical Society, the Mechanics Institute and the

reconciliation, for better understanding between employers and workers and between the respectable and the outcasts of society.", "Her writing was carefully researched, and she took particular care in reproducing northern dialects accurately.", "Despite her occasional tendency towards melodrama, Elizabeth had a natural gift for storytelling and Dickens referred to her as his 'dear Scheherazade'.", "She originally published anonymously but, according to Victorian conventions, her readers came to know her as 'Mrs Gaskell' a name which made her sound matronly and safe.", "Elizabeth Gaskell (as we prefer to call her) was actually courageous and progressive in her style and subject matter, and often framed her stories as critiques of Victorian attitudes (particularly those towards women).", "She braved the opprobrium of her husband's Unitarian congregation, in part for her depiction of prostitution and illegitimacy, particularly in her novel Ruth, and also for her challenge to the traditional

abroad most years, travelling to France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.", "She was usually accompanied by at least one of her daughters, rather than her husband, as William preferred to holiday alone..", "She was, at the same time, a caring wife and mother, attractive and well-liked.", "At ease in any company, she was chatty, sociable and a prolific writer of letters.", "She had a wide circle of friends, which included Charlotte Bront\u00eb, John Ruskin, the Carlyles, Charles Kingsley and Florence Nightingale.", "Although they shared many artistic concerns, Elizabeth had a difficult working relationship with Charles Dickens who, as editor, often wanted to alter what she wrote.", "On one occasion, exasperated by her perceived waywardness as a contributor, he exclaimed to his sub-

The descendants of these colonists make up a large portion of the population of Sarmiento and still speak Afrikaans and attend the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk (\"Dutch Reformed Church\") to this day.

in question.", "The Treaty of Fort Wayne was signed, and for Tecumseh, it was the last straw.", "He openly courted British military assistance, and redoubled efforts at assembling a confederacy of tribes to retake lost Indian lands.", "Word of this trouble reached Harrison through his network of spies among the Indian tribes, and he began asking President Madison to fund military preparations.", "Madison, not eager to start a fight, dragged his feet, and Harrison attempted to negotiate an end to the crisis with Tecumseh.", "He sent a letter to the chief, warning him: \"Our Blue Coats (U.S. Army soldiers) are more numerous than you can count, and our hunting shirts (volunteer militiamen) are like the leaves of the forests or the grains of sand on the Wabash.\"", "#### War with Tecumseh", "Tecumseh and his elite guard of about 75 warriors confronted Harrison and his officials outside the governor's Grouseland home on August 15, 1810.", "The two had never met in person, and for days the impassioned Tecumseh berated the affable, condescending Harrison.", "He plainly told the governor that any further incursions into Indian lands would mean war.", "Harrison insisted that the land had been acquired legally, and Tecumseh began shouting that the governor was a liar.", "Swords and war clubs were drawn, pistols cocked, and for a few seconds both sides stared one another down.", "The council broke up, and negotiations never really got back on track.", "Tecumseh traveled throughout the great territory, recruiting tribes for his quest to retake it.", "Harrison became increasingly concerned that the chief's actions would slow Indiana's statehood and his own political climb, leaving it \"the haunt of a few wretched savages.\"", "Indian raids on outlying settlements increased.", "In the late summer of 1811, the Madison administration finally sanctioned a raid to punish the Native Americans.", "Despite being thirteen years removed from military experience, Harrison managed to convince the President to allow him to command the operation.", "In October, he set out from Vincennes with a mixed force of regular Army troops, volunteers, and militia.", "Harrison saw it as a good time for such a strike because Tecumseh was out of the territory recruiting allies for his cause; in his absence, the Indians were led by his brother, Tenskwatawa, a spiritual leader known as the \"Prophet.\"", "#### Battle at Tippecanoe", "On the sixth day of November in 1811, Harrison's force of about 950 moved into position outside the Prophet's camp, beside a small river known as the Tippecanoe.", "Tired from their march, they made a camp of their own and prepared to attack the next day.", "It had been a long time since Harrison had commanded troops, and the rust quickly showed.", "The Indians discovered his force by the campfires he had allowed, and they infiltrated his camp before dawn on November 7.", "Outnumbered, the Prophet's warriors were short of ammunition, but they had surprise on their side.", "Several Army officers were killed, and their men broke and ran.", "Others staggered from their tents.", "Dazed with sleep and terror, silhouetted against the campfires, many were cut down by the Prophet's warriors.", "Harrison leapt onto his horse almost immediately, rallying his men.", "Try as they might, the Indians could not get through the Army rifle lines and get the bulk of their force inside the camp.", "They broke off the attack and melted into the woods.", "Harrison ordered a counterattack that was successful in routing the Native Americans by midmorning.", "The graves of several Indians killed in the battle were dug up and desecrated.", "The battle became the talk of the young nation.", "Public reaction to Harrison's actions ran mixed, but was on the whole favorable.", "There were mutterings of poor generalship and the steep loss of life, but others welcomed the revenge on the Indians whose raids had increased in frequency and severity on the western frontier.", "#### War of 1812 and Battle at Thames River", "The Battle of Tippecanoe was good for William Henry Harrison and no one else.", "While the Native American alliance had been badly frayed, it only hardened the resolve of warrior chiefs like Tecumseh.", "Now they were not just fighting to retake their land; they were seeking revenge.", "Vicious new raids terrified the settlers.", "In the meantime, relations with Britain had worsened badly, and when America declared war against it in the summer of 1812 the Indians were even further emboldened.", "By fall, Harrison commanded all forces in the Northwest with the rank of major general.", "With the country ill prepared for war, it had been a disastrous summer for the American cause.", "Much of the Indiana Territory had fallen to British control, and the fortress at Detroit had surrendered disgracefully.", "Harrison received orders to retake Detroit and thus bolster morale, but Harrison cautiously held back, unwilling to press the war northward.", "In September of 1813, however, Americans regained control of Lake Erie with Oliver Hazard Perry's smashing victory over the British fleet.", "Once Perry sent the message, \"We have met the enemy and they are ours,\" England's prime supply line into the United was severed.", "American troops could now be ferried across the lake into Canada to engage the British.", "By the end of the month, Harrison's forces had retaken Detroit; they turned to chasing down the British and Native Americans.", "Among them was Harrison's old enemy, Tecumseh.", "On October 5, Harrison engaged the enemy in what is now Kent County in the province of Ontario, near a river called the Thames.", "Harrison's force outnumbered the British-Indian contingent three to one and contained a band of Kentucky marksmen who were tremendous close-in fighters.", "The British, poorly deployed and ill trained for such warfare, either fell dead or surrendered.", "Their general fled the battlefield.", "The Native Americans fared better, fighting off the initial assault by Harrison's men.", "But the American force was relentless and finally overpowering.", "Tecumseh was killed, and the Indians were routed, their alliance in the region smashed for good.", "The victory did much the same for Harrison that the triumph at New Orleans did for Andrew Jackson later in the war.", "(See Jackson biography, Life Before the Presidency section, for details.)", "The War of 1812 had been a string of demoralizing defeats for the Americans, and the conflict was unpopular with many factions.", "The victory at the Thames River boosted American morale and secured the national reputation of its commander.", "Harrison, however, handled his sudden fame in a very different fashion than Old Hickory, and the difference speaks volumes about each man.", "Jackson remained in the war and led expeditions against Native American contingents for years afterward.", "The battle at the Thames River, on the other hand, virtually finished Harrison's military career.", "Instead of following up on his triumph and wiping out the remaining British in Canada, Harrison took leave from the Army and undertook a tour of New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, soaking up the adulation offered by each city.", "He stayed in the East for months, choosing celebrity over duty, enjoying parties and banquets in his honor.", "In May of 1814, with the war still raging, William Henry Harrison resigned from the Army once again and settled into life on his farm in North Bend, near Cincinnati.", "He was forty-one years old.", "#### A Quarter-Century in the Political Wilderness", "Harrison's climb to political power would be a long and rocky one.", "He spent the following twenty-five years, well into his late sixties, trying to seek office of one kind or another.", "He was successful in getting to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1816 to 1819.", "He lived well beyond his means and soon plunged deep into debt.", "Harrison tried to secure the office of secretary of war in the new administration of President James Monroe but lost out to John C. Calhoun.", "Harrison was also passed over for a diplomatic post to Russia.", "His political career began to come to a close.", "After his term in Congress, he returned to Ohio, won a post in its state senate, then lost a bid for governor of the state in 1820.", "Over the next two years, he ran for both of Ohio's seats in the U.S. Senate and lost both races.", "The failures peaked with an unsuccessful attempt to return to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1822, at the age of 59.", "Personal tragedy showed its face, too: six of Harrison's ten children died between 1817 and 1840.", "Harrison kept trying, and in 1824 he finally won a U.S. Senate seat.", "He had barely arrived in Washington, D.C., before he began angling for posts.", "He secured appointments to two military committees.", "Then Harrison prevailed on his old friend Henry Clay\u2014now secretary of state to the new President, John Quincy Adams\u2014to be named an ambassador to Colombia.", "Clay managed to push the appointment through in 1828, despite Adams's distaste for what he considered Harrison's \"rabid thirst for lucrative office.\"", "Colombia was a volatile post in early 1829, torn by revolution and foreign war.", "Harrison's missteps were bad and frequent.", "He failed to show neutrality in the nation's affairs and publicly sided with the opposition to President Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.", "Colombia angrily planned to expel the envoy.", "When Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency in March, he quickly recalled his old foe and used the post to repay a political favor from his campaign.", "Harrison returned to Ohio, where his farm did not perform well, and money problems grew; he was reduced to a menial job as recorder for his county to make ends meet.", "### William Freehling", "Emeritus Professor of Humanities", "University of Kentucky", "### More Resources", "###### William Harrison Presidency Page", "### William Harrison Essays", "###### Life in Brief", "###### Life Before the Presidency (Current Essay)", "###### Campaigns and Elections", "###### Domestic Affairs", "###### Foreign Affairs", "###### Death of the President", "###### Family Life", "###### The American Franchise", "###### Impact and Legacy"], "meta": {"id": "test04225", "claim_title": "William Henry Harrison", "claim_section": "Early life and education.", "claim_context": "Harrison was the seventh and youngest child of Benjamin Harrison V and Elizabeth (Bassett) Harrison, born on February 9, 1773 at Berkeley Plantation, the Harrison family home along the James River in Charles City County, Virginia.

brings out another side of him as well, it just makes for a better a product.", "You can't really produce somebody through email.", "You can send them a beat, but if you don't like the hook when they send it back you can say that but they might've already lived with it and played it a million times.", "If I was in the studio with them they might say, \"Yo I've got this idea for a hook\" and I

put a real emphasis on finding talent, which isn't always a role that's associated with producers.", "I think I find talent better than I actually make music.", "I guess that comes from that DJ

arguments abound about how to address the problem - so much so that a solution may not be achieved for years.", "Meanwhile, for thousands and thousands, the trip across Lake Washington has become a daily trial by traffic.", "Dan Piraino, a 16-year veteran of what has become the daily crawl along Highway 520, can vouch that there was a time when the highway was as clear as August in Seattle and the commute was an easy 15-mile trip.", "Today, the research scientist must roll out of bed by 5:30 a.m. to beat traffic and has joined a van pool to capitalize on car-pool lanes.", "If he were to

6-year-old daughter graduates from college.", "Yet, despite a long history of failed attempts to improve 520, a new effort to find a solution is raising hopes of proponents.", "There are new concerns about the soundness of the bridge and a growing fear that traffic is getting so bad it will strangle economic growth.", "Some recent developments:", "-- The state's chief bridge engineer says some $88 million in immediate and long-term repairs are needed if the bridge is to remain safe and usable for another 20 years.", "That's about enough time to plan, fund and build a new bridge.", "-- An informal coalition of Eastside business leaders, backed by the city of Bellevue, has been meeting with legislators, and Seattle and Eastside residents to drum up support for a $3 million study of how best to move people and freight across the north end of Lake Washington.", "Support for the study seems to be growing and includes endorsements last week from the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and the Montlake Community Club.", "-- A new Bellevue Transportation Department study shows that cross-lake drivers are overwhelming city streets as they head to Interstate 90 trying to avoid Highway 520 backups.", "Seven studies, but no action", "One thing is sure: A new bridge or bridge improvements won't be built quickly or without a battle.", "It took 14 years of planning and argument to build the first 520 bridge.", "Thirty years of debate preceded completion of I-90 across the lake.", "Among the objections to a larger bridge: concerns of residents at each end that it would add traffic through their neighborhoods, the high cost of construction, and beliefs that expanding capacity isn't a smart way to deal with worsening congestion.", "At least seven major studies have looked at ways to cut congestion on 520, the first just nine years after the bridge opened.", "Adding rail service or making changes to inspire car pooling were among the ideas studied.", "But no proposal from any of these studies was implemented.", "The last study, in 1993, by Washington Transportation Partners (WTP), a public-private partnership, suggested spending $550 million to $900 million to either replace the bridge or build a parallel structure with bus and car-pool lanes.", "The proposal to finance the job with tolls so angered residents on both sides of the bridge that it was abandoned.", "Meanwhile, traffic jams worsened as Microsoft led an employment boom that put thousands more commuters on the road.", "Almost as many of Microsoft's 9,000 Redmond employees commute to work from Seattle as from the Eastside.", "Last spring, representatives from Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, Bellevue Square and other economic powerhouses met quietly on the Microsoft campus to discuss concerns that the region's economic vitality would wither should highways become so clogged employees couldn't get to work and freight couldn't get to market.", "They urged the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) to include a $3 million study of Highway 520 and possible construction of new transit lanes across the lake in last fall's (successful) $3.9 billion ballot issue.", "But the RTA board refused on grounds that a bridge study would doom its transit plan a second time.", "Business leaders are again pushing for a $3 million study of the \"520 corridor.\"", "Half of the money would come from the state through a transportation-revenue package that hasn't yet been funded.", "The Puget Sound Regional Council is applying for federal matching funds to pay for the rest.", "\"We can't ignore it any more.", "It's a critical corridor.", "There's too much growth on the Eastside to ignore it,\" said Barry Murphy, Microsoft's regional government-affairs manager.", "But choosing which options to study is a political hot potato.", "John Okamoto, the Department of Transportation's regional administrator, proposes that a broad-based advisory committee decide.", "Some ideas already making the rounds: better roads around the north end of the lake; a new bridge farther north; a wider 520 bridge; restricting some lanes to car pools, buses or light rail; and discouraging auto use by imposing tolls or work-site parking fees.", "Many activists, including members of \"No Expansion of 520,\" say bigger freeways aren't the answer.", "\"The era of the single-occupant vehicle, I think, is coming to an end.", "It's plain we can't keep on building highways so everyone can go to work in his or her own car and return home in his or her own car,\" said Cornelius Peck, former UW law professor and co-founder of the Seattle-based group.", "Peck's view is supported by a recent state Department of Transportation (DOT) analysis of possible improvements to Interstate 405, which says that even if the state spent $2 billion to add as many as three lanes in each direction, average traffic speeds would still fall to 28 miles per hour by 2020.", "No money for construction", "Even if a study of 520 were to be done, there's no money in state coffers to carry out its recommendations.", "With gas-tax revenue outpaced by construction costs, DOT has only enough money to maintain existing highways.", "Highway advocates in the Legislature already face an uphill battle to pass a revenue package that would generate $647 million in new highway funds over the next two years and $869 million the following two years.", "DOT's most recent estimates for adding two new transit lanes and making other fixes to the 520 bridge range from $710 million to $890 million.", "Winning Eastern Washington legislators' support for using the state's entire highway-building budget on a Seattle-area project would be difficult, to say the least.", "It isn't clear whether - or when - the 520 bridge will rise to the top of DOT's priority list.", "Unless it were funded with tolls, it would have to compete with other projects such as adding more high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the state's freeways, expanding the

According to medieval Rabbinical enumerations of the 613 commandments, the commandment to procreate is the first mitzvah in the Torah: \"And God blessed them; and God said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply [\"peru urevu\" (\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5)], and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth\" (Genesis, 1:28). This commandment was understood by the early rabbis to be only binding on men; women are exempt because childbirth puts them in physical danger, though a dissenting opinion is recorded in the mishnah Yevamot 6:6. This commandment was originally binding on all of humanity, as it was given to Adam, the progenitor of all mankind. However, after the giving of the Torah, it became obligatory on Jews only. \n There are many passages in the Babylonian Talmud that relate to the Jewish attitude toward sexuality. In one passage (BT Berakhot 62a), a rabbi named Kahana hides underneath the bed of his teacher Rav as Rav was having sex. Rav scolded Kahana for his behavior, but Kahana countered that sex is part of the Torah, and therefore he must learn about it from his teacher. \n According to the Sefer haChinnuch, the central nature of this mitzvah is due to the fact that God desires for the world to be populated."}}

UAE Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashidi responded to the accusations by stating that Al Qaeda cannot be reasoned with and cited that they killed many of his soldiers. The UAE military stated that accusations of allowing AQAP to leave with cash contradict their primary objective of depriving AQAP of its financial strength. The notion of the coalition recruiting or paying AQAP has been thoroughly denied by the United States Pentagon with Colonel Robert Manning, spokesperson of the Pentagon, calling the news source \"patently false\". The governor of Hadramut Faraj al-Bahsani, dismissed the accusations that Al Qaeda has joined with the coalition rank, explaining that if they did there would be sleeper cells and that he would be \"the first one to be killed\".

Council.", "In 2017 the possibility to elect the members of the Senate through the Electoral Colleges in the Caribean part of the Netherlands has been anchored in the constitution.", "The elections take place within three months of the Provincial Council and Electoral Colleges elections.", "## What is the function of the Senate?", "The Senate's main duties are in the legislative field, but it also plays a role in scrutinising the actions of the Government.", "Formally the Senate can only reject or accept legislation.", "In practice, however, it has rather more possibilities and debates are of importance.", "For example, statements made by government ministers in debates on bills (draft legislation) can play a role in future lawsuits.", "The debates in the Senate contribute to the interpretation of a law.", "Moreover, members of the Senate can elicit undertakings from ministers about the implementation of a law.", "Like their counterparts in the House of Representatives, members of the Senate are entitled to put written questions to the Government.", "The debate on the Government's budget also gives them the opportunity to debate current and future policy with the

assesses bills by reference to its own criteria after they have passed through the House of Representatives.", "The legislative process can be fairly protracted.", "Sometimes it takes five or six years before a bill becomes law.", "The Government and the House of Representatives often amend the text of a bill during this process.", "Furthermore, new information and ideas may emerge while a bill is passing through Parliament.", "This means that revision is essential.", "The main purpose of revision is to ascertain whether the final bill is of sufficient quality and to ensure that it does not conflict with the constitution or international treaties or jeopardise the rights of citizens disproportionately.", "The legislation as a whole must also remain affordable.", "## How did the Senate come into existence?", "The Senate has existed since 1815, the year in which it was instituted by King William I.", "When the Netherlands and Belgium were united in 1815 the Belgians in particular pressed for the introduction of a bicameral system.", "In its early years the Senate served as a bulwark of the Crown (i.e. the King and his ministers) since it was still able to block bills that displeased the King.", "Such bills were usually private member's bills from the House of Representatives.", "At that time, the members of the House of Representatives too were elected indirectly.", "The members of the Senate were not elected, but were confidants of the King and were appointed for life.", "The Senate remained in existence after the separation from Belgium in 1830.", "Much changed in the political sphere as a result of the introduction of a new constitution in 1848.", "The position of the Senate and the criteria governing eligibility to stand for election were among the changes.", "Monitoring the quality of legislation gradually came to be the main function of the Senate after 1848.", "It thus became a revising chamber or 'Chambre de reflection'.", "## How are bills dealt with by the Senate?", "Directly after a bill has been passed by the House of Representatives it is sent to the Senate.", "Here the bill is submitted to a parliamentary committee.", "The committee decides whether the bill can be immediately put on the agenda of the full chamber or whether there should first be preparatory study of the bill.", "If a bill is immediately put on the agenda of the full chamber, it will be passed as a formality without a debate.", "The preparatory study of a bill consists mainly in written correspondence and the exchange of documents.", "The members of the committee present the views of their parliamentary party in writing and put questions to the Government.", "The Government replies in a note or memorandum of reply.", "Sometimes, there may be several rounds of correspondence, but one is generally considered sufficient.", "After the written preparations have been completed, the Senate is notified that the bill is ready for debate by the full chamber.", "In due course the bill is then put on the plenary agenda.", "## What else do members of the Senate do?", "The main function of members of the Senate is to scrutinise and revise bills.", "To do this effectively, they read the official papers and reports as well as letters and articles from newspapers and periodicals.", "The members sometimes receive hundreds of letters before a bill is dealt with.", "Members of the Senate also confer internally and externally.", "Internal consultations are held for the most part within the parliamentary party or committee concerned.", "The procedure to be adopted is one of the matters discussed in the committee meetings.", "External consultations are held with organisations and citizens.", "Sometimes members receive visitors or delegations.", "And in special circumstances a committee may decide to hold a hearing.", "Members of the Senate also have the right to ask the Government written questions about issues unconnected with a bill.", "However, they make only limited use of this right.", "The general view is that scrutinising the policy and actions of the Government is first and foremost the responsibility of the

Six of the venues were used during the 2013 Confederations Cup. However, six further stadiums missed FIFA's original 31 December 2013 deadline for completed works. The completion of the new Arena Corinthians was hindered by a fatal crane collapse in November 2013 that destroyed part of the stadium and killed two construction workers. Slow progress at the Arena da Baixada site in Curitiba led to FIFA threatening to drop the stadium as a host venue in January 2014 unless significant progress was made during the following month; after being satisfied of progress, FIFA confirmed that Curitiba would remain a host city.\n During the first three months of 2014, the first games were staged at the venues in Manaus (Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia), Natal and Porto Alegre. However, following an inspection of all the venues in May 2014, FIFA Secretary Valcke expressed concerns about the readiness of the Natal, Porto Alegre and S\u00e3o Paulo venues, with additional test events still being required."}}

Davis kill Spahn ranch hand Donald \"Shorty\" Shea. The jury returned verdicts of life imprisonment for Manson and Davis, but death for Grogan. However, on December 23, 1971, Judge James Kolts stated that \"Grogan was too stupid and too hopped on drugs to decide anything on his own\" and that it was really Manson \"who decided who lived or died\" and reduced Grogan's sentence to life imprisonment.\n Grogan later assisted the authorities and drew a map to where Shea's body was buried. In prison he was head of the prison's program to deter juveniles from a life of crime and kept away from fellow inmate Manson. Grogan was released on parole from prison in 1985."}}

return on his own to the United States as \"a marked man\".", "The realisation that the normally icy-cool astronaut was so obsessed by such an outcome puts a fresh perspective on the celebrations that

had serious doubts about its reliability.", "Should the engine fail to ignite, Armstrong and Aldrin would be stranded on the Moon - where they would die when their oxygen ran out.", "Or if it failed

and Aldrin walking on the lunar surface - fretted about his two companions below him on the Moon and revealed, in a note written at the time, that he was now \"sweating like a nervous bride\" as he waited to hear from the Eagle.", "\"My secret terror for the last six months has been leaving them on the Moon and returning to Earth alone; now I am within minutes of finding out the truth of the

Collins.", "His worst fear had not materialised and he returned safely to Earth in the company of Armstrong and Aldrin, unmarked by the experience.", "He would not suffer a fate of global notoriety.", "In fact, the opposite happened.", "Collins was forgotten.", "Today most people still know the names of the two first men on the Moon and recall the words, delivered by Armstrong, about taking a giant leap for mankind.", "But the name Michael Collins is rarely recalled, despite his critical role in the historic flight of Apollo 11.", "Not that he holds grudges.", "\"It was an honour,\" he said last week.", "In fact, he was - in many ways - the unsung hero of the Apollo 11 mission, a point that was underlined at the time by the great American aviator Charles Lindbergh.", "He wrote to Collins, not

Columbia, that were both blasted into space on a giant Saturn V rocket on 16 July 1969.", "For three days, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins cruised towards the Moon inside Columbia and spent their time gazing \"out the window at the Earth getting smaller and smaller and checking the spacecraft\", according to Aldrin.", "Then, on 20 July, Armstrong and Aldrin crawled into Eagle and flew it down to the Moon's surface.", "\"Keep talking to me, guys,\" radioed an initially panicky Collins as the pair drifted away from his ship.", "Minutes later, Columbia swept behind the Moon and Collins became Earth's most distant solo traveller, separated from the rest of humanity by 250,000 miles of space and by the bulk of the Moon, which blocked all radio transmissions to and from mission control.", "He was out of sight and out of contact with his home planet.", "\"I am now truly alone and absolutely alone from any known life.", "I am it,\" he wrote in his capsule.", "Lindbergh's remarks were certainly accurate.", "Such solitude would have unnerved most people.", "But not Collins.", "He says the emotion that he experienced most during his day alone in lunar orbit was that of exultation.",

with his wife, Patricia, whom he married in 1958.", "The couple have three grown-up children.", "Collins was born in Rome on 31 October 1930.", "His father, Major-General James Lawton Collins, was then serving overseas with the US army.", "Collins later graduated from West Point and joined the US air force.", "An early assignment was to the 21st Fighter-Bomber Wing at George Air Force Base, where he learned how to drop nuclear weapons.", "He joined the astronaut corps in 1962 and flew on one of America's two-man Gemini capsules with veteran astronaut John Young, who flew on a later Apollo mission.", "Then came his selection for Apollo 11.", "After his return to Earth, Collins gave up space travel and pursued a career in bureaucracy and business.", "He was director of the National Air and Space Museum until 1978, before being appointed vice-president of LTV Aerospace in Arlington, Virginia.", "He resigned in 1985 to start his own business.", "Today he remains cheerful about his role on Apollo 11, although he describes himself as becoming increasingly grumpy.", "\"At age 78, some things about current society irritate me, such as the adulation of celebrities and inflation of heroism,\" he said last week.", "Neither description fits him, he added.", "\"Heroes abound, but don't count astronauts among them.", "We worked very hard, we did our jobs to near perfection, but that is what we had been hired to do.\"", "He describes himself today as moderately busy, \"running, biking, swimming, fishing, painting, cooking, reading, worrying about the stock

reached the far side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins that there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of \"Columbia\" might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the offending system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When \"Columbia\" came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the far side of the Moon as \"relaxing\". After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for \"Eagle\" to meet up with \"Columbia\", Collins was prepared for certain contingencies in which he would fly \"Columbia\" down to meet \"Eagle\". After spending so much time with the CSM, Collins felt compelled to leave his mark on it, so during the second night following their return from the Moon, he went to the lower equipment bay of the CM and wrote:\n In a July 2009 interview with \"The Guardian\", Collins revealed that he was very worried about Armstrong and Aldrin's safety."}}

enmity between Demdike and her deformed daughter Elizabeth and a neighbour called Anne Whittle (Chattox) and her daughter, all of whom were witches living in Pendle Forest.", "After further

The next morning, Arthur suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and never regained consciousness; he died the following day, November 18, at the age of 57. On November 22, a private funeral was held at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in New York City, attended by President Cleveland and ex-President Hayes, among other notables. Arthur was buried with his family members and ancestors in the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York. He was laid beside his wife in a sarcophagus on a large corner of the plot. In 1889, a monument was placed on Arthur's burial plot by sculptor Ephraim Keyser of New York, consisting of a giant bronze female angel figure placing a bronze palm leaf on a granite sarcophagus."}}

facing the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London.", "It is under threat of demolition to make way for a temporary parliamentary debating chamber.", "Photograph: Marc Zakian/Alamy", "The architectural career of William Whitfield, who has died aged 98, ranged from the concrete assertiveness of new brutalism to a new Palladian mansion that won plaudits from traditionalists.", "The office he founded in 1961 and led as principal developed a design approach that brought together different ideas and styles, not as compromise, but synthesis.", "His extension to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the City of London (1970) squeezed a tall concrete tower into a tight site and managed the joins to the baroque of John Belcher's 1892 original building with great finesse and wit.", "The hammered concrete and elegant modernist facades alongside older work won round many to the gutsy beauty of brutalism.", "Later came three schemes at cathedrals: a new chapter house for St Albans (1981), its beautiful structural brickwork giving more than a nod to Edwin Lutyens; an international study centre in the cathedral close at Canterbury, now Canterbury Cathedral Lodge (2000), setting Purbeck ragstone and stock brick alongside French limestone; and new buildings for the Mappa Mundi and chained library at Hereford (1996).", "Whitfield's sensitivity to context served him well at a time when, to the relief of many, it had become a prized architectural skill.", "Nevertheless, every kind of lay and ecclesiastical obstacle was encountered \u2013 from medieval burials unexpectedly discovered to outright opposition to anything newly built next to ancient cathedrals.", "Whitfield and his always small office overcame them, to widespread acclaim and admiration once the buildings were finished.", "He was the architect for the restoration of Hawksmoor's Christ Church Spitalfields for three decades from the early 1970s, surveyor of the fabric at St Paul's Cathedral (1985-90) and a trustee of the British Museum.", "In 1993 he was knighted.", "New offices for the Department of Health (1987) were built between New Scotland Yard (then being repurposed as offices for MPs), the Regency Richmond Terrace, which had lain empty for years while governments dithered about demolishing it, and a narrow frontage to Whitehall directly overlooking the Cenotaph.", "On this fearsomely awkward and sensitive site a design of skill and complexity was achieved.", "Richmond Terrace was refurbished by others, while Whitfield built against its rear substantial office accommodation that was layered and staggered so that every office had natural light.", "Fine cast concrete staircases and ceilings gave it gravitas internally and beautiful detailing and leadwork outside did the same.", "The stair towers were clad in red brick with stone dressings to pick up the \"streaky bacon\" facades of New Scotland Yard.", "Facing the Cenotaph, Whitfield designed a recessed entrance in stone and yellow brick with a composition of bay windows and turrets that evokes, but at no point directly copies, Tudor precedent.", "It is a building of great sophistication but the department left it in 2017, and a parliamentary committee is now considering demolishing it, to erect a temporary debating chamber.", "Skill and patience with clients, planners and public opinion served the Whitfield office well at the redevelopment of Paternoster Square (2003), immediately north of St Paul's.", "It was one of the great planning showdowns between traditionalists and modernists but was finally built to Whitfield's master plan.", "Some of the buildings were to his own design, while others were awarded to selected practitioners, so that it reads as a piece of urban fabric rather than a through-designed development.", "Paternoster Square has proved more popular with the public than with architectural opinion formers, and is wearing remarkably well.", "Born in Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, William spent his early years in Newcastle upon Tyne and considered himself a proud Northumbrian (and therefore, he once said, \"barely English\").", "He took the family name of his mother, Elsie Whitfield, when his father disappeared very early in his life, and was brought up in a household of formidable women of three generations from a coal-owning family whose business was taken over by the National Coal Board in 1946.", "The young William cycled huge distances around Northumberland and the Borders, drawing prolifically and beautifully, and the resulting love of castles and towers never left him.", "He was admitted to Newcastle School of Architecture (then part of the University of Durham) in 1935 at the age of 15 by special dispensation, on the basis of a portfolio of drawings, supported by a remarkable breadth of architectural knowledge.", "Whitfield had a facility for vividly visualising plan-forms in three dimensions.", "He later recalled that his \"rough sketch\" stage was an entirely cerebral process.", "Only after thinking through configurations would he start to draw.", "Graduating in 1941, he was qualified when the second world war call-up came, so exempt, and returned to take a planning degree under Tom Sharp immediately after the war.", "He first came to notice as the junior of a team of three who in 1954 published plans for a \"New Barbican\" in bombed areas of the City of London.", "Though unbuilt, these proposals, with towers of then record-breaking height, galvanised the City into a plan of its own, designed by others.", "It is not fanciful to see the New Barbican megastructures \u2013 with ambitious scale, high density, and a new sense of urban form \u2013 grinning through today's Barbican.", "Another unbuilt scheme came in 1960, when Whitfield won the competition for new government offices and a conference centre in Broad Sanctuary, directly opposite Westminster Abbey.", "Slender towers for lifts and stairs clustered around blocks of accommodation, the towers breaking up the bulk of the building by their vertical emphasis.", "Whitfield's facades had rectangular modules based on those found in both Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster, a deft piece of contextualism before such a thing was commonplace.", "The fact that it was not realised was down to indecision and the proposals announced in 1965 to bulldoze much of Whitehall.", "Of three structures for the newly independent Newcastle University, just one survives, the Hadrian Building (formerly the King's Road Centre, 1964).", "With it Whitfield ran a very long facade of beautifully detailed copper windows and daring cantilevers (apparently unsupported sections) against the quaint neo-Jacobean 1920s student union building.", "His final building there (recently transformed beyond recognition) was the University Theatre (1970), a flexible performance space for teaching and experimental productions.", "It included two bars within the auditorium itself and a third cafe-bar, open during the day in an attempt to bridge the town-gown gap.", "At Glasgow University's new library (1968), on the expanding Hillhead campus, Whitfield created a cluster of thin towers at one of the highest points in the city.", "The library has been miserably modified by recent alteration, but at the adjacent slightly later Hunterian Art Gallery his hammered concrete survives.", "It also had a display space for fittings from Charles Rennie Mackintosh's former residence (which the university had controversially demolished).", "The Mackintosh \"house\" in concrete did not attempt a full replica externally, but is powerful as a ghostly evocation in white-stained concrete: memory made real.", "Andrew Lockwood was a partner in the practice from 1991; following its closure in 2002 they worked together as Whitfield Lockwood Architects, completing the classical mansion for Wafic Sa\u00efd at Tusmore, Oxfordshire, in 2004.", "Set in an existing mature landscape park, the house has a two-storey frontage backing on to a three-storey one, to outstanding effect in the central circular hall.", "The garden front might owe something to the English classicist Sir Robert Taylor in the way that it hints at the disposition of spaces within, and the entrance front refers to Palladio.", "But Tusmore acknowledges precedents without being enslaved to them and was hailed in Country Life as the \"finest postwar classical house in Britain\".", "Whitfield's accretive synthesis of form across boundaries of style and period lies at its heart.", "As he once said in an interview: \"Style is not an issue.", "It is a matter of what is appropriate.\"", "Whitfield died at St Helen Hall, St Helen Auckland, Co Durham, the lofty 18th-century Palladian house that he had purchased when it was at imminent risk of demolition and patiently restored.", "Lockwood, who became his civil partner in 2006, survives him.", "\u2022 William Whitfield,

ground\u2014it was explicitly intended as the means to another, far more grandiose and idealistic end: colonizing Mars.", "Musk has said that he feels this is imperative for two reasons.", "One is that it would be an inspiring adventure and we need such goals.", "The other is the long-\u00adterm survival of humankind.", "If a calamity, self\u00ad-made or otherwise, destroyed life on Earth, as

fortune from PayPal, to the point where he was reduced to borrowing money off friends for living expenses.", "And how, at the last minute, doom was averted: The fourth SpaceX launch reached orbit, and the company was awarded a $1.6 billion NASA contract; other Tesla investors agreed to match Musk's final $20 million investment and saw them through the most vulnerable moments.", "Even now, Musk gets

there's something he's had to do to get people in a mindset where they're more scared of failure, but his answer is basically that a rocket blowing up\u2014or, to use the actual jargon, undergoing a

Borchetta contrasted \"The Launch\" to other reality music competition series such as \"American Idol\" (where he mentored during its fourteenth season) and \"The Voice\", by emphasizing its focus on a song itself rather than just performers. He explained that \"going 20-plus weeks seeing who gets voted in as the winner, then trying to figure out the song and producer, it just felt like we can do a better job with that much attention and that many sets of ears and eyes paying attention to the show.\"\n Borchetta added that record producers had \"a lot of great songs that just haven't had the right opportunity\", such as Stephan Moccio, who supplied a song he had worked on whilst working on the soundtrack for \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Bell Media president and former Universal Music Canada head Randy Lennox (who has previously worked with Borchetta) described the pace of the format, where producers are given 48 hours to work with the two candidate musicians to record their debut single, as being \"star-making machinery meets Kiefer Sutherland \"24\"\". The winners' songs receive additional production work in between the completion of episode production and their public release. \n Over 10,000 applications were received for the first season; Borchetta explained that Canada had a large pool of untapped musical talent because there were no \"opportunities\" to kickstart their careers (unlike the U.S., whose talent had, in his opinion,  been \"gone through over and over again\" by competing programs), and noted that there was a sense of pride over domestic artists. He emphasized that the series \"isn't about somebody that has never performed before getting a record deal; this is about an artist who's ready and just needs this big break. This is the big break.\" Bell Media's vertical integration is leveraged as an aspect of the series; the winning songs are featured on Bell Media Radio stations and the division's iHeartRadio service, and the series is also covered as part of other CTV programs."}}

His stories are simple and portray Conan overcoming a series of obstacles to defeat the antagonists with his physical prowess.   Nihilistic originally intended to stay faithful to the literature, but the writers strayed from the canon by showing the barbarian as willing to use magic. The literary Conan abhors magic, but Nihilistic reasoned that, in order to restore his armor to its original non-magical state, he is willing to use the magic it has been cursed with.\n The developers did, however, stay true to the physical depictions of the barbarian.

The draft is used as the primary means to distribute newly available talent (primarily from college football) equitably amongst the teams. Selections are made in reverse order based on the previous season's record, i.e., the club with the worst record from the previous season selects first. Through 2009, only two exceptions were made to this order: the Super Bowl champion always selects last (32nd), and the Super Bowl loser second to last (31st). Beginning in 2010, teams making the playoffs have been seeded in reverse order depending upon how far they advance. The draft consists of seven rounds. Teams have the option of trading selections for players, cash and/or other selections (including future year selections). Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. The Patriots traded their first-round pick six times (1972, 1974, 2000, 2009, 2013, and 2017)."}}

Howard committed suicide in 2006 following a diagnosis with an unspecified form of advanced stage cancer. The song 'Roses on My Grave' was written in his memory. Before releasing their major label debut album Infest, Papa Roach recorded and published an EP in 1994 entitled 'Potatoes For Christmas'. In 1997, their first full-length album, entitled Old Friends from Young Years, was released. \n Shaddix stopped using rapping as a whole in their 2004 album \"Getting Away with Murder\".

In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of \"Return of the Jedi\", Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of \"A New Hope\".\n Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language dialogue were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, whose work is not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet's limbs and mouth."}}

Influenza symptoms are a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia, body ache, headache, and fatigue. Diarrhea is not usually a symptom of influenza in adults, although it has been seen in some human cases of the H5N1 \"bird flu\" and can be a symptom in children. The symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in the adjacent table.\n The specific combination of fever and cough has been found to be the best predictor; diagnostic accuracy increases with a body temperature above 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Two decision analysis studies suggest that \"during local outbreaks\" of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%. Even in the absence of a local outbreak, diagnosis may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.\n The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests."}}

Not all these renovations were beneficial: painted 18th century ceilings were overpainted white, and the dining room was divided into service rooms, allowing the large service wing to be abandoned to rot. \n A form of salvation for West Wycombe was Sir John's wife: Lady Dashwood, the former Helen Eaton, a Canadian and sister of American novelist Evelyn Eaton, was a socialite who loved entertaining, and did so in some style at West Wycombe throughout the 1930s. Living a semi-estranged life from her husband, occupying opposite ends of the mansion, she frequently gave \"large and stylish\" house parties. \n During World War II, the house saw service as a depository for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park was used for the inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses."}}

and official authority never interested him.", "He did not even care to have his theological degree from the University, which he, of course, received.", "He was completely indifferent to such things.", "When someone understands the absolute nature of this indifference, he also understand how and why Bishop Gerasimos of Abydos remained a monk of the Holy Mountain, and particularly of the Skete of St. Anna, while he lived and served in the great metropolitan cities of the two continents and in the great university centers of the world: Boston, Oxford, Munich, Athens.", "Given his advanced age, he prepared himself, nevertheless, for the introductory examinations to the School of Theology in Athens.", "He experienced some difficulties in the literary part of the examination, but had excellent results in the mathematical.", "He entered the School of Theology and began with greater zeal to follow the courses which were being taught during that era by such great professors as

Karmires.", "From the beginning, Professor Louvaris became his favorite, perhaps because of his profound thought and thorough knowledge of philosophy, which distinguished him, and which he used to emphasize the value of the truths of faith.", "During this same period, other young men were studying theology and had distinguished careers later, such as Dionysios Psarianos (now Metropolitan of Kozani), Gabriel Kalokairinos (later Metropolitan of Thera), Makarios Kykkotis (later Archbishop of Cyprus), Silas Koskinas (later Metropolitan of New Jersey, U.S.A.), Basil Moustakis (author, poet)

addition to all the other misfortunes, the students missed out on their regular studies.", "For the rest of his lifetime, Gerasimos of Abydos would regret this loss, which he considered great, particularly since what he was doing he was doing for a more comprehensive understanding of the truth.", "This is why he always valued greatly the service of teaching, the oral lesson, when the professor would attempt, through various ways, to analyze and expand the horizons of learning.", "It is certainly not fortuitous that he himself loved to teach, and he loved it a great deal.", "While, as we said, he was indifferent to positions of authority, he had a great desire, from this time onward, to acquire the qualifications for teaching, to become a teacher, to speak all the more profoundly and convincingly about the simple and certain faith which he acquired experientially on the Holy Mountain.", "In the meantime, and even though he did not have an exceptional voice, he was

and everything was overthrown.", "At the end of May 1941, with the breakdown of the front in the Greek-Bulgarian boundary, he was ordained - although he never considered himself worthy of it - a priest by Metropolitan Michael of Corinth.", "He now had the Priesthood for which he never considered himself worthy.", "However, he did everything that he could for an entire lifetime to honor it.", "At this point we must emphasize that even when he became a bishop in 1962, he believed steadfastly that the priesthood is one.", "He believed that the bishop has nothing more than the priest, being only an archpriest, the first among priests.", "Primarily the bishop has the particular charisma from God to ordain other priests.", "The bishop as a hierarch is naturally the leader of the priests, who also celebrate the sacraments as validly as the bishop, once they have received the priesthood, the Sacred Tradition of the Church.", "It is understood of course that the priests must be united in faith with the bishop, who in turn also has the faith of the whole Church.", "Once, when defending these opinions and explaining to me how and why he came these conclusions, he said: \"How does the Eucharist which I celebrate as a bishop differ from the Eucharist which a priest of my diocese celebrates?", "Since there is no difference, we have the same priesthood.\"", "At the beginning of the German occupation in 1942, Archbishop Damaskenos, who already knew and had helped him economically and morally and who continued to esteem him highly, appointed him to be Director of the Orphanage of Vouliagmeni.", "This responsibility offered nothing toward his profound theological aspirations.", "Those years, however, were so difficult that he felt obliged to accept the position.", "For three years, under terribly unfavorable conditions, he cared for the orphaned children not only to survive but also to experience some nurturing love.", "During the course of the war and the occupation, he helped many people to survive hunger and persecutions, while, at the same time, he pursued with his familiar thirst the meager spiritual activities of the period: lecture, lessons, meetings and conversations with spiritual people.", "Liturgical life with the tradition of the Holy Mountain constituted the strong foundation, while he sought further knowledge that would help him understand those things he believed.", "During the occupation, he often visited his professor Nikolaos Louvaris.", "He continued to do this even after the professor had been imprisoned at the end of 1944, because of his participation in the last occupational government of Athens (at the request of Archbishop Damaskenos himself to serve as Minister of Education for national reasons.", "Among these reasons was the extraction of a promise from the Germans to expel the Bulgarians from the Greek territories in the north.)", "### Chancellor of the Metropolis of Corinth", "Toward the end of 1945, Metropolitan Michael of Corinth offered him the position of Chancellor.", "With mixed feelings he accepted.", "He was concerned over this involvement in administrative matters, but being only thirty-five years old at the time he was daring enough to accept the post.", "He respected and highly esteemed his bishop Michael, who in turn loved and entrusted his Chancellor.", "Everything was going well, as long as he left most administrative matters in the hands of the secretaries of the Metropolis.", "The ecclesiastical environment of Corinth included traditionalists, who were attached to the forms without understanding their essence, as well as certain hyper-nationalists and some liberals.", "He himself avoided all extremes, emphasized the need for understanding the essence of things, and worked diligently to establish a balanced view.", "In particular he wanted to be close to the priests, to create harmony among them, to support them, to point out to them that they should not be involved in the politico-ideological battles of the opponents in the Greek Civil War.", "Of course, he already held the opinion that Communism was an evil not only because it denied Christ, but also because it did not really care about man, and therefore could not help him essentially.", "But he never justified the crimes of the anti-Communists either.", "During his years as Chancellor, when he was responsible for preaching and writing, he became more conscious of his limitations.", "This became clear to him in his capacity as the first co-worker of Metropolitan Michael in the publication of the periodical of that time The Apostle Paul, where he himself had to contribute articles and to publish, for the first time, some of his writings.", "It was then that he realized the demands and responsibilities of writing.", "He had become so sensitive to this awesome responsibility that, even though he wrote throughout his life and kept notes and expressed his opinions on paper, having composed entire commentaries on the books of the New Testament (on the Gospel of John, the Gospel of Mark, the Letters of St. Paul), including short articles on various theological and biblical subjects, only relatively few of them have been published: two complete volumes, a great many articles in periodicals and two additional texts - a book and a lengthy essay - are presently in the process of publication.", "The rest of his writings, gathered in five large cartons, still remain in manuscript form, not knowing yet what may be publishable.", "### Seeking Knowledge in Germany - The Study of Philosophy", "His thirst for deeper research and knowledge was growing.", "His idea for studies outside of Greece was also maturing.", "From his professors, and particularly from Professor Louvaris, he had come to appreciate German scholarship.", "Ecclesiastical leaders were recommending England or America to him.", "He refused.", "He was offered the position of priest of the Orthodox Church in Munich.", "He accepted.", "In September of 1947 he was ready.", "He had strange and conflicting emotions.", "He had come to know the evil side of the Nazi soldiers while at the orphanage in Vouliagmeni, where he and all the orphans had been forcefully expelled.", "The condition of post-war occupied Germany was then terrible: poverty, crime and uncertainty.", "Nevertheless, the professors and the writers who had survived began once again to work diligently and systematically - so characteristic of these people.", "Thus the Archimandrite Gerasimos, at the age of 37, embarked for Munich, Germany, without knowing any German.", "It was an adventurous trip.", "The occupation forces assigned him to a room and he began his work.", "It was the work of a pastor to a small trouble-filled congregation with many problems, and a systematic and extensive study of the German language.", "With patience and persistence he succeeded.", "What did he study in the capital of Roman Catholic Bavaria?", "When he began he planned to study the New Testament.", "And this is what he would say when asked at the Roman Catholic School of Theology at the university.", "In fact, however, he had spent more time studying Greek philosophy.", "He considered it essential to learn how the philosophers thought about the great questions of man - especially about the question of God.", "He was fascinated beyond imagination by these questions, and he would be constantly testing whatever it was they were seeking, attempting, and devising.", "It was clear that inquisitive spirit was still unsatisfied.", "All of these questions, immersed as he was in the Greek philosophers and especially Plato and Aristotle, inspired him and he appreciated them greatly.", "He appreciated this philosophical thinking so much so that he characterized an element of it as a propaedeia to Christianity.", "This is why his first book, the product of research of that period in Germany until the Spring of 1951, was given the title: Greek Philosophy as Propaideia to Christianity.", "This work was published in Athens in 1954.", "Toward this direction in his thought, he was influenced by the famous Romano Guardini, who theologized while philosophizing and created literature while speaking.", "Literature appears to have never drawn the attention of Gerasimos of Abydos.", "However, to theologize by following the successes or failures of philosophy interested him a great deal.", "It was something like an exercise for him to comprehend more deeply the truths of faith, which philosophy did not possess.", "This approach and point of view has something that is wisely contradictory.", "But he insisted until the end of his life that philosophy actually helped him.", "And this despite the fact that all of his writings after 1954 do not show that he indeed was helped by philosophy.", "Everything clearly constitutes a deeper penetration into the revealed truth of Sacred Scripture and Tradition.", "How philosophy actually helped him is known only to him.", "If we were to risk an interpretation of this fact, we would say the following: Gerasimos of Abydos, through his virtue of love and understanding for people, was able to appreciate any obscure or undeveloped formulations of the philosophers about God and man, in comparison to the truth, and as a spiritual man could show condescension for the failures of philosophers.", "Such failures, however, were for him occasions to marvel all the more the faith and the tradition which he had lived on the Holy Mountain.", "Moreover, he would always understand the historical journey of mankind, as well as divine economy itself, as a unified whole, in which he indirectly if not in expressis verbis included Greek philosophy.", "The intense and often successful - in minor issues - involvement of Greek philosophy with the great questions (something which had not yet been consciously and so deeply accomplished in world history) constituted a sort of preparation for man to come before the revelatory work of God and particularly that of the Incarnation.", "More concretely, he would emphasize throughout his life that we owe to philosophy our thirst for something higher, more sublime.", "It was philosophy that created in us the desire and brought us \"thirsty\" up to the point of the coming of Christ.", "And thirsty as we were, we \"drank\" from the living water of Christ and accepted Him.", "### Greece or America", "The sojourn in Germany was coming to an end.", "It was Spring of 1951 when the first invitations - completely unexpected - reached him to consider going to America.", "Metropolitan Michael was now Archbishop of North and South America and he wanted to have his former Chancellor, Gerasimos Papadopoulos, by his side.", "But things did not go well at first.", "He went first to Greece, where strong ecclesiastical personalities, such as Metropolitan Agathonikos of Kalavrita and Aigialeias, Metropolitan Prokopios of Corinth and others, wanted him to stay in Greece, promising to make him a metropolitan.", "While certainly not scornful of this latter prospect, he was not much moved by it.", "The then Archbishop Spyridon offered him the position of spiritual father at the large student dormitory of Apostolike Diakonia.", "He accepted this responsibility, which lasted for only one academic year, but this proved to be a wonderful year for the students.", "In most such religious programs at this time, a spirit of moralism prevailed.", "Archimandrite Gerasimos Papadopoulos, however, was kindling in the souls of the students a love for Christ and opening their wings for flights into the life of the Spirit.", "He believed most steadfastly that the opening of the wings of the students had the greatest significance.", "He believed that with outstretched wings they could fly and find their way, even with some diversions they would reach their goal, they would mature, they would experience the true Christ.", "On the contrary, without wings at all, or with folded wings, they would never be able to fly; they would remain spiritually weak and immature infants throughout their lives.", "And if I have understood him correctly, it is in this that the deeper reason lies for encouraging the students then to study and pay attention to the teaching of Louvaris.", "While disagreeing with him on many points, he nevertheless appreciated how his writings helped the students to spread their intellectual wings.", "He broadened, rather than narrowed, the ways of the Spirit.", "He appreciated his work as the spiritual father of the students and had determined to stay in Greece.", "### America - Holy Cross School of Theology", "Once again America beckoned.", "Archbishop Michael had not been disappointed.", "He sent a bishop to convince Gerasimos to come to America.", "He relented and accepted the invitation.", "Various communities were considered for him in some of the larger American cities.", "Fortunately these proposals were not successful and Archbishop Michael appointed him to be Professor of New Testament and chaplain at Holy Cross School of Theology in Boston, near some of the greatest universities of America.", "By July of 1952 he was in Boston.", "He had to prepare himself systematically.", "He worked most diligently in a super-human manner, doing research and preparing texts for the students to study.", "They in turn were not always well equipped and the work of teaching them was very difficult.", "He had no time, after all, for extensive scholastic literary, historical and critical analyses.", "He had to concentrate on the necessary, the basic, the essential elements.", "This was in harmony with his own character.", "He therefore drew and concentrated the interest of the students upon the presuppositions, the goal, the thought, the theology of the New Testament writings.", "The end result of this effort was the ease and depth of movement within the whole realm of the New Testament.", "Many of the proposals of the liberal interpreters of Protestantism he considered to be immature things.", "Once when they told him that Bultmann supported that the original order of the chapters in the Gospel of St. John was different, he responded like this: \"We cannot prove that the order was originally different.", "Bultmann supports another order of the chapters simply because with that order he understands John better and thus would have preferred the Gospel to have been written in that order.\"", "Such forms of criticism and the questions raised about Sacred Scripture by many liberal scholars tend to deny something in Scripture, rather than to help man to understand more deeply the truth.", "In the area of criticism he did not negate everything.", "For example, he agreed that a particular saying of the Lord could have been uttered originally in a somewhat different form.", "He believed, however, that for the Evangelist to record it, it was certainly uttered by the Lord and it constituted an essential aspect of the faith and the Tradition of the Church.", "It is a revelation.", "He attempted to comprehend revelation for himself and to make it understandable for the students by also using reason, to a certain degree.", "He held that Christian Faith possesses an inner logic and consequence which must be comprehensible.", "It was not an easy matter, yet he pushed on in that direction as much as he could, as much as it was permitted, after all, by the truth that is inexhaustible for us.", "As soon as he would reach the ends of logic or of his own capabilities, he would surrender himself completely to the declaration of Scripture, to its straight forward theology, to the \"so it is written.\"", "Any fantastic creation of new truths, that is, of another Christ, or a denial and a falsification of what we have in Scripture constitute a heresy.", "He only sought to go deeper into the divine truths, to attempt to know more profoundly the truths of Scripture.", "This is what he considered to be the goal of the exegete and of the theologian.", "He believed, however, that the exegetes and the theologians have difficulties in understanding the truth, primarily because we do not live as much as we should the life of Christ.", "If we surrender to Christ, then the Holy Spirit \"will guide you (us) into all the truth\" (Jn. 16.13-15).", "### Father \"G.U.L.F.\"", "His life at the Holy Cross School of Theology was not without difficulties.", "The spirit that motivated him was different from the spirit of the Dean, Fr. Ezekiel Tsoukalas, who had the unfortunate inspiration to name him sub-dean of the School.", "The conflicts were many.", "Archimandrite Professor Gerasimos refused to oppress the students through the school program.", "He confronted them with a different spirit.", "He would convince them to work, but freely, uncoerced.", "And the students would respond accordingly.", "They came to more than love Gerasimos, who quickly came to be known in the code language of the students as Fr. \"G.U.L.F.\" - the initial letters for Gerasimos, Understanding, Love, Faith.", "These were the perennial issues he discussed with them, and that's why they had become his code name for many years.", "With every opportunity and particularly at night his room would fill with students.", "There were never enough chairs and they would sit on the floor and in the hall.", "They made inquiries, carried on discussions, listened and were satisfied with much love and learning.", "It was what these young men were seeking, particularly in this situation, who would in two or three years be ordained into the priesthood.", "He lived for the students, no more no less.", "He worked to acquire knowledge and he prayed for God to give him perseverance.", "Thus he overcame the crises and the disappointments coming from the Dean, who reached the point of first depriving him of his position as Sub-dean and then asking for his removal from the School.", "The Dean did not succeed in his latter plan, much to the delight of the students, who lost no opportunity to express their esteem and devotion for their professor, \"Fr. G.U.L.F.\"", "This reaction served as the highest form of consolation for the professor, who found perseverance and persistence to continue the work of teaching and nurturing spiritually the students to the best of his ability.", "During his tenure at Holy Cross it was necessary to teach courses beyond his own field and to undertake even the entire administration of the School, as Acting Dean, which he did not particularly like.", "### Service to the Orthodox of America", "His popularity, which was simultaneously scientific and spiritual, passed beyond the boundaries of Holy Cross.", "Very soon he was invited and in demand for lectures, homilies, and director of retreat discussions in various cities of the United States.", "He gave particular attention himself to the New England Federation of Orthodox Students.", "It was the first environment, outside of the School, where he had been invited to confront certain critical issues - theological and social - but in a different manner than the one he had been exposed to at the University of Athens and later of Munich.", "Here the interests of the students, who came from various university schools, were of a more general character and were not contained strictly within the realm of theological subjects.", "The need to respond to such demands required him to be initiated into and to become conscious of the intense concerns of the people of the new world.", "These critical issues had their own presuppositions and, in their external signs, were very different from those Fr. Gerasimos knew in Greece and in Germany.", "Therefore, the speaker had to acquire as soon as possible a new inner private training, if he really desired to help these young people and if he indeed possessed the necessary capabilities.", "And he succeeded.", "This is why he was greatly esteemed in these circles, where he became a close friend of the well-known Russian theologian, Fr. Georges Florovsky, who also gave lectures in these same circles.", "This was only the beginning of his activity outside of Holy Cross.", "He extended himself to ever broader areas and to other metropolitan areas besides Boston.", "This activity often took the form of a series of lectures during spiritual retreats or of a series of Bible studies.", "This activity continued until the last winter of his life.", "He also pursued advanced studies at universities in Boston, receiving a Master of Theology in 1957 from Boston University.", "This grounded him and prepared him for the spiritual reality of the New World.", "This was his fourth and final stage of studies, which he continued with youthful zeal until his last breath.", "Of the three previous stages of studies, the first was accomplished on the Holy Mountain, the second at the University of Athens, and the third at the University of Munich.", "One must appreciate the presuppositions, the character, the depth and the breadth of each of these stages, if one truly wants to understand their assimilating spirit and their benevolent influence upon Gerasimos, the Bishop of Abydos.", "### The Reality of Orthodoxy in America", "How quickly he came to understand the problems of the new world is obvious also in the fact that only several months after his arrival in America, he dealt with courageous realism the great problem of Greek Orthodoxy in America, the problem of the Greek language.", "He not only spoke about it, but he also wrote about it, and declared openly that if we want to teach Orthodoxy to our children, if we want them to want to come to our Church, and especially if we want them to be consciously Orthodox Christians, we must speak to them in English, but without this to mean that we should abandon the Greek language.", "He took this position in 1952 and 1953, when no one would dare approach this dramatic problem among the great multitudes of diaspora in America.", "He favored the introduction of some English in the Liturgy from that time, yet he still insisted until his end that no matter how many decades pass, no matter how many changes take place, no matter how little the congregation understands the Greek language, a portion of the Divine Liturgy, even a small portion, must continue to be in Greek, in the language of Scripture and our ancient Tradition.", "The teaching ministry of our Church, however, must be in the language of the people.", "In order to more fully understand this, we must emphasize something else.", "In the innermost being of the Archimandrite Gerasimos of that period a real drama was unfolding.", "He, who had a real passion for the Greek philosophers and so loved their thought, was also and first of all a monk of the Holy Mountain.", "He experienced Orthodoxy upon its acropolis; he experienced it in the hearts of the ascetics, who lived consciously the Sacred Tradition of nineteen centuries of Orthodoxy.", "This is how Orthodoxy was planted into his deepest being.", "Orthodoxy led to salvation.", "Yet, Hellenism had also profoundly influenced his spirit.", "Fr. Gerasimos felt the obligation to give preference to one of the two.", "A violent inner struggle took place.", "He struggled to see if he could have both fully.", "It was impossible.", "He was disappointed and frustrated.", "The decision had to be made.", "The soul nurtured by the Holy Mountain took precedence.", "Salvation must come first, the Greek language can follow.", "Christian Orthodoxy is first, Hellenism follows.", "### Hierarch by Obedience", "At the end of 1961 Archbishop Iakovos insisted that Fr. Gerasimos become bishop for Detroit.", "Archimandrite Gerasimos refused for two reasons.", "He loved his teaching ministry at the School of Theology very much, which he considered to be suited for him and which he would have to abandon.", "Secondly, he felt that he had no calling for administrative work, which he would be obliged to carry out as bishop.", "The Archbishop, however, who esteemed him very much, both for his capabilities and for his spiritual life, did not give up on the idea.", "Months later, without telling Fr. Gerasimos anything, the Archbishop spoke to Patriarch Athenagoras.", "On April 6, 1962 the Synod of the Patriarchate elected Gerasimos as titular Bishop of Abydos.", "On the day after the election the Archbishop announced the news to Gerasimos, who chose not to say no to the voice of the Church.", "On May 20, 1962 he was consecrated in Boston and would serve as the Bishop of the Diocese of Boston.", "### Life as a Bishop", "His period of service in the Diocese of Boston would not continue for too many years.", "Certain difficulties in the Pittsburgh Diocese required the presence of Gerasimos of Abydos.", "As he began his ministry as a bishop, which continued administratively until 1977, he was fully aware of his own shortcomings, those of his flock and, naturally, those of his priests.", "He never liked absolute formulations, because they did not belong to the tradition, nor were they realistic.", "And in order to face the problems of the flock in an edifying manner, he followed a traditional principle: economia and flexibility on secondary matters, strictness on matters of faith.", "This principle he attempted to inspire into his priests, with whom he labored as co-workers.", "He had regular assemblies with them and - most importantly - he know how to listen to them, a prized virtue in a bishop.", "Thus he managed to be supportive in their difficult work as priests in the communities, to earn their trust and to make easier the solution of many problems.", "He did not have the slightest difficulty in saying to his priests that they, in their parishes, are the \"bishops.\"", "Naturally there were certain disagreements and conflicts.", "He was the bishop and had tremendous responsibilities, the primary responsibility, and often had to impose the opinion which he judged to be the correct one.", "But even this was always done with consultations, with discussion of the issues, so that it was not like some authoritative and autocratic imposition.", "His episcopal ministry both in Boston and in Pittsburgh was truly successful, since undoubtedly the flock and the priests considered him as their spiritual father, who wanted and could help them spiritually.", "He worked and behaved in such a way that all wanted to approach him and to confide in him.", "All knew that he had many things to offer on all the matters of the faith and the spiritual life.", "Yet, he never believed that his service was perfect, or that he had avoided mistakes.", "He considered his episcopal ministry to be a soft-spoken one.", "He did not try to impose his authority or impress people.", "He did not change or overthrow any existing conditions.", "He only wanted to help the people live more fully and more deeply their life in Christ, the life of the Church.", "In particular, he always tried to show the faithful the wonderful and saving majesty of the Divine Liturgy.", "During the synods of the Greek Orthodox Bishops of all America, under the presidency of Archbishop Iakovos, his presence was positive and edifying when he spoke and even when he did not speak.", "He had the prudence to listen with an open mind and to understand that, in general, the opinion of the Archbishop would prevail.", "But he also had the necessary courage and outspokenness to express his own opinion and to support what he believed to be correct, independently of any concerns that might be unpleasant.", "In such circumstance he never fostered ulterior motives nor a disposition to insult anyone.", "In all of his activities and various cooperative efforts with simple lay people, with officials, with priests, with fellow bishops and with the Archbishop he always sought to achieve a balance - a moderation in all things - which he managed to transform into what he himself would call reality.", "This realism presupposes the knowledge of what is ideally correct, the recognition of the limited capabilities and dispositions of people, as well as the pursuit of what is attainable.", "One who is spiritually advanced is never satisfied with merely what is simply attainable, but one accepts it with condescension, hoping that at least it will serve as a first step for further progress.", "### Interlude at Oxford and Return to Holy Cross", "In 1965, as Bishop of Boston, after continuous teaching and pastoral labors, he felt something like an inner emptiness.", "At the same time, he was seeking out great scholars to discuss certain important problems of theology in the New Testament.", "Moreover, he was seeking a brief period of relaxation, to set aside his pastoral responsibilities for the sake of relaxed theological discussions without interruptions.", "Thus, for several months he went to Oxford, England.", "He visited libraries and attended various lectures.", "But this was secondary.", "The significant thing for Bishop Gerasimos, who by now had 55 years upon his shoulders, was the opportunity to discuss at length with many - over ten - prominent professors and exegetes.", "He was prepared to listen, but was impressed because most of them were also prepared to listen to him.", "They were not Orthodox, but he was nevertheless interested in seeing how they thought about critical issues, about issues that perhaps they did not care to write about.", "Within his soul the Orthodoxy of the Holy Mountain prevailed absolutely, but he was prepared to accept some corrections in his thought about the person of Christ and the divine Economy.", "Most characteristic of his character and the degree of his spiritual life was his great love for discussions, concerning the person of Christ and the difficult theological issues related to the life of faith of the faithful.", "He did want to discuss other subjects, and had no interest in hearing what one is doing, how another was insulted, and other similar things.", "Until his very last days and hours, he wanted to discuss with passion only theological subjects, about \"our Christ,\" as he used to say.", "It is characteristic that in April 1995, after several months, professor and Metropolitan Demetrios of Vresthena, a person he esteemed highly, came to visit him.", "After the usual greetings about their health, the two bishops sat down because Bishop Gerasimos wanted to discuss and to ask questions.", "To the Metropolitan's inquiry, \"What shall we talk about, Geronta?\"", "Bishop Gerasimos responded: \"Why, about our Christ, of course, what else?\"", "Ultimately, Bishop Gerasimos was not enlightened in Oxford, as he would say, from the discussions which he enjoyed with the truly wise persons he had met there.", "He appreciated them, he relaxed and continued there, until certain problems at Holy Cross forced the Archbishop to recall him to Boston in a hurry.", "It was then that he was given the responsibility to be the Dean of the School of Theology, which he, of course, loved most dearly.", "Later, of course, other problems in Pittsburgh would require his peacemaking presence there.", "### Retirement", "At the age of 67, that is, in 1977, he retired from the administrative and pastoral responsibilities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.", "He had asked to retire in 1976.", "He wanted to find time for writing and for spiritual cultivation.", "He always considered very little that which he had achieved internally.", "Finally, his retirement was accepted on June 19, 1977.", "What impressive coincidences!", "He was ordained a deacon on June 17, 1935, the day of the Holy Spirit; he gave his spirit on June 12, 1995 on the day of the Holy Spirit.", "The news of his retirement, for those who did not know him well, made an impression.", "He was still at the prime of his life, working many hours in the day, and people did not expect that he would retire.", "As a clergyman, a teacher par excellence, a writer, a reader and a spiritual father, this act of his was also perfectly understandable.", "And this is why for them the Bishop's retirement was a courageous act.", "This is why it was esteemed and marveled at from all sides.", "Moreover, everyone knew that Bishop Gerasimos was not seeking honors and authoritative positions, thrones and acclamations.", "But precisely because he did not seek thrones or authorities, he was truly enthroned in the hearts of the people.", "And he remained enthroned there, where he still is and will always be.", "In Pittsburgh, a farewell banquet was organized in his honor, and the greetings and farewell wishes expressed that evening", "constitute a monument of gratitude and profound estimation for the departing bishop.", "Representatives of the clergy and of the communities, of the national Greek-American Associations, and of the faithful people of the Diocese spoke most affectionately and with great admiration for their beloved bishop.", "Naturally, of course, the Archbishop also spoke to honor Bishop Gerasimos.", "Before, during and after the farewell banquet, Bishop Gerasimos felt various conflicting emotions: What had been completed in his life?", "Should it have come to an end?", "What was to begin now?", "Had forty-two years of intensive preparation and activity as a clergyman received their seal of completion, or would they find some worthy continuity?", "And what form will such continuity take?", "He had thought about everything a year before.", "Now, however, he was pressured emotionally by these thoughts.", "And the pressure was considerable.", "Most of all he was sad over his separation from the people he loved and who loved him.", "His consolation was that a new bishop, younger in years, would be able to offer more for them and would love them just as much.", "He believed that people ought not to grow too old in these positions.", "Immediately after his retirement, he traveled to Greece.", "He went back to the Holy Mountain.", "His cell at St. Anna was now in ruins.", "A thought he had about living there the rest of his life took flight when he looked upon his ruined cell and the little chapel, where he lived and prayed for four years in simplicity, with frugality - a characteristic virtue and mark of his entire life.", "At this point I shall describe an incident, over which I had a considerable internal debate regarding whether or not to record it.", "Because, however, it has been confirmed by an abbot of a monastery, I feel that I should mention it.", "The visit of Bishop Gerasimos to the Holy Mountain coincided with the feast day of the main church of the St. Anna Skete.", "As a bishop of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and a former monk of Mt. Athos, a few of the old monks who remembered him, particularly the monks of Fr. Chrysostomos Kartsonas, naturally, wanted him to celebrate the Divine Liturgy at the great festival of St. Anna.", "Bishop Gerasimos, however, because he had been living in America had a short, trimmed beard.", "This prompted some of the monks of the Skete to oppose his liturgizing because, they claimed, the people would be scandalized seeing him with a trimmed beard.", "When they clearly intimated their perplexity over this matter, Bishop Gerasimos dismissed it, giving it no thought at all.", "He simply went and stood in a back corner of the church as if nothing had happened, and he remained there from the beginning of the all night vigil until late the next day when the Divine Liturgy was celebrated.", "There, alone, without any distinctive signs, a stranger among strangers, he recalled his old monastic experiences and prayed as much as he could.", "It is the custom during the vigil of the feast day of St. Anna for the hesychast ascetics and hermit monks, who live a very austere monasticism in poor, isolated kalyves, far from the Sketes and Monasteries, to gather silently in the central church.", "After the liturgy, one of these ascetic monks approached two leading monks of the Skete and asked them: \"Who was that clergyman who stood in that corner stasidi?\"", "They explained to him that he was Bishop Gerasimos of Abydos, who had not been permitted to liturgize because he had trimmed his beard.", "Then the ascetic monk crossed himself and told them: \"What have you done?", "How could you?", "All night long I could see over his head a light like a dove, while over your heads there appeared something like little devils!\"", "I verified the information regarding this incident, and when I mentioned it to Bishop Gerasimos himself, he confirmed everything except the reference to a dove, about which he knew nothing.", "At first, after retirement, his thought was to settle somewhere in Greece.", "Arrangements had been made with me because we would have been staying together.", "He even had sent ahead a small portion of his books, since his destination was Greece.", "Deliberations had also been made for him to teach a few hours at the Rizarios Ecclesiastical School in Athens.", "### America Asks for a Spiritual Father", "While there were many signs indicating that Bishop Gerasimos would prefer to settle in Greece, and particularly in Athens, to be near the libraries, the clear and fervent voice of the Greek Orthodox faithful of America moved him and won him over.", "Messages would come to him in Greece, informing him that he was wanted and needed there in America.", "I remember how the now Metropolitan Silas (Koskinas) had come then to conjure me: \"Do not pressure your uncle to remain in Athens, we need him in America!", "We need a spiritual father to talk to, our priests especially and even we the bishops.\"", "I too had been shaken by all these urgent messages.", "But I had not yet understood how much the blessed Elder loved the Theological School of the Holy Cross.", "He submitted to the invitations of the people of America, but with the understanding that he would return to his beloved School, to teach according to his ability, living on campus but not being involved with the administrative responsibilities of the School, of the Diocese, or any other institution.", "### Again at Holy Cross - Teacher, Writer, Counsellor", "His terms were accepted.", "They sent him an urgent express letter.", "He obeyed the voice of the Church.", "He returned and took up residence in a typical student apartment, consisting of two small rooms.", "This happened on November 1977.", "There at the School, in a truly idyllic environment, on that verdant hill with innumerable trees, many of which he had planted himself and cared for dearly, Bishop Gerasimos lived another eighteen years as professor and counselor and spiritual father to the students.", "It was for this purpose that he had been invited to come back.", "In fact, the blessed Elder felt that he had never really left the School, but rather had lived there continuously since 1952, when he first came to America.", "Of course, he had served ten years as Bishop in Pittsburgh, but because he was always close to the School in spirit, he felt that he had never been absent from his beloved School on the hill.", "At the School, without seeking it, he became immediately the spiritual center.", "For four years he continued to teach with the load of a full time professor.", "Later he taught part time and then occasionally.", "For a few years it was necessary to teach the course in Dogmatics.", "He used to read and prepare himself with youthful vigor.", "He took advantage of this need of the School to study more profoundly for himself the Fathers of the Church, and to attempt to transmit their spirit to the students who would become priests in the future and would need to live with the help of the Fathers.", "### Study and Writing to the Very End", "It seems incredible, but in his retirement Bishop Gerasimos would work all day long.", "Until the very last days and hours of his life, he continued to read and to write, in spite of the fact that since the beginning of the 1980's serious health problems had appeared.", "A very serious case of septicemia had kept him for days in a state of aphasia.", "Later, problems appeared with his heart, which were treated with pills and patience.", "But the rhythm of his work was not interrupted.", "Even in the summer, during his vacation, he followed the same routine without losing any time.", "During virtually all of the summers after 1977, he traveled to Greece.", "And, of course, Greece meant primarily the village where he was born, Bouzi (now called Kyllini) of Corinth, Stymphalia, on the sides of Mt. Tzereia.", "He would spent about a week in Athens at the most and then he would go directly to Bouzi.", "There, again, during July and August, he would rise early and after his morning prayer, would begin his study immediately.", "He did the same in the afternoon until late.", "Whenever he arrived from America, he would seek out significant publications in contemporary Greek Orthodox theology, and particularly works of the Church Fathers commenting on biblical passages.", "He would not only read these books but would also take notes from them, marking in pencil important passages and whatever he considered useful to him.", "He had read and taken notes from virtually all of the significant works of the biblical scholars in the Schools of Theology of Greece.", "Parallel with this study, in spite of old age and the health problems of his heart and his feet, he did not neglect to serve the Liturgy in the various larger or smaller mountain towns.", "He never refused an invitation.", "He usually only refused to wear the episcopal miter during Liturgy.", "And so each summer the faithful in the mountain towns of Corinth looked forward with great anticipation for a visit from Bishop Gerasimos.", "During his years in retirement, Bishop Gerasimos devoted much time to teaching, but also to preparation of his very significant book, Orthodoxy, Faith and Life and a Greek edition in one volume, Orthodoxia - Piste kai Zoe, in Athens in 1987.", "This is not the place to analyze this work, but it should be noted that it sums up a very profound analysis and understanding of the work of divine economy for the salvation of the world.", "This particular analysis of the work of Christ surpasses in depth but also in simplicity many other parallel attempts.", "In this book an Orthodox bishop speaks about Christ and the Church, a bishop who for many years was a persistent researcher, who studied considerably the secular wisdom, who knew well the opinions of the heterodox, and - most importantly - he had been living the truth for fifty years in prayer and worship.", "Thus, the work presupposes knowledge and personal experiences and is written in order to edify the reader in a spiritual way.", "Whoever studies this book, regardless if one is a theologian or not, he will be filled with divine spirit and will be virtually incorporated into the Church.", "Following this book, Reflections on Our Christian Faith and Life was published in 1995, after Bishop Gerasimos fell asleep in the Lord.", "Another work on the eschatological faith of the Church will be printed in the very near future.", "The teaching and the writing work of Bishop Gerasimos drew, of course, the attention, the estimation and the admiration of professors, students and ecclesiastical circles.", "Moreover, during these eighteen years, the requests for lectures and Bible studies in various communities and university centers throughout the United States continued to come one after the other.", "Consequently, an ever widening circle of spiritual men and women and scholars were able to experience and appreciate the gift of the blessed Bishop Gerasimos.", "### The Abba of America - Living the Sacred Tradition", "But above and beyond all these things that have been related, the blessed Bishop Gerasimos was also something else: he was an Abba - a Father.", "He was a teacher to whom the young and the old would run at every difficulty with strictly theological issues.", "He was also the spiritual Father, the Abba, the comforter, the counselor.", "A whole world lived in the School and even a greater one far from it.", "But everyone knew that up there on the hill, a little beyond the chapel of the Holy Cross, there lived a wise and holy Elder.", "In his simple quarters he prayed and studied alone and was always ready to receive all.", "The very certainty that there lived such a man was itself a consolation.", "The students would pass by his window and would feel secure.", "From the central buildings and the classrooms the professors and administrators knew that at any difficult time the wise Elder had something prudent and helpful to say to them.", "The pain and the crossroads of life, the falls and the sins of spiritual people would take the path toward the room of the wise and holy Elder.", "Innumerable people, clergymen and laymen and laywomen, placed before him, again and again, the failures they experienced in their upward spiritual journey.", "He in turn would share their pain, but would also share their joy wherever they had succeeded well.", "With or without the stole over his neck, the blessed Bishop always served as an Abba, as a spiritual Father, as a Father confessor and comforter.", "And everyone - indeed everyone - would leave his cell always, more or less, strengthened and renewed in spirit.", "This work of the Elder, the Abba, was among the most burdensome and most difficult in the life of the Church.", "It staggers and empties the spiritual man who has profound sacred experiences and who possesses spiritual wealth that he readily offers to those who come to him.", "(People simply did not come to him who did not possess such a spiritual life).", "The blessed Bishop possessed such a spiritual life.", "He had it in abundance indeed, but he himself believed that it was poor, very poor.", "This is why until the very last hours of his life he continued to renew himself, to live with prayer and worship the truth, the mystery of Christ and of life, as he loved to remark.", "This was so because Bishop Gerasimos, although surrounded by the greatest universities of the world, lived with the daily prayer services as a simple monk.", "These nurtured him; through them he was \"rebaptized\" and lived.", "Early in the morning and every evening he was present, as in the old days on Mt. Athos, in the Chapel of the Holy Cross.", "And he loved to be the celebrant of the Divine Liturgy, as a simple priest, even more frequently than the young clergymen who loved to serve.", "It was enough for the students to see him in the Chapel without fail as an old man of so many years to be silently but consciously instructed, nurtured and edified.", "With or without saying it, they felt certain of the fact: the Tradition lives!", "Bishop Gerasimos was the Tradition!", "No one could tell them that the Tradition had been lost, that it was only in the past.", "They had the Tradition alive before them!", "This is the great contribution of the blessed Bishop.", "This is perhaps the reason why he had to live the faith and to continue his ascetic struggle in America, in \"our Theological School,\" as he loved to say.", "Taken from the book: Agape and Diakonia: Essays in Memory of Bishop Gerasimos of Abydos"], "meta": {"id": "test02919", "claim_title": "Abydos (Hellespont)", "claim_section": "Ecclesiastical history.", "claim_context": "The bishopric of Abydus appears in all the \"Notitiae Episcopatuum\" of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the mid-7th century until the time of Andronikos III Palaiologos (1341), first as a suffragan of Cyzicus and then from 1084 as a metropolitan see without suffragans. The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcian, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458, protesting about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. A letter of Peter the Fuller (471\u2013488) mentions a bishop of Abydus called Pamphilus. Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against Severus of Antioch and others. Isidore was at the Third Council of Constantinople (680\u2013681), John at the Trullan Council (692), Theodore at the Second Council of Nicaea (787). An unnamed bishop of Abydus was a counsellor of Emperor Nikephoros II in 969.\n Seals attest Theodosius as bishop of Abydos in the 11th century, and John as metropolitan bishop of Abydos in the 11/12th century. Abydos remained a metropolitan see until the city fell to the Turks in the 14th century."}}

highlights as we impatiently anticipate Il Cinema Ritrovato, coming up in a little over two months.", "Publications on Albert Capellani", "In reporting on the 2010 and 2011 programs of Il Cinema Ritrovato, I highlighted one of the festival's major revelations, that of the silent films of Albert Capellani.", "These generous doses of Capellani's splendid films were put together by Mariann Lewinsky, who realized his importance after she included some of his shorts in her annual \"Cento Anni Fa\" programs.", "In my entries I argued that Capellani was revealed as one of the early cinema's great masters.", "(The 2010 entry is here, and the 2011 one here.)", "Not surprisingly, during the intervening years, scholars have been busy researching Capellani's films and career.", "March 6 to 24 saw a major retrospective at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise.", "(Information on the program is still available online, as is a detailed press release.)", "Shortly before it began, the first biography appeared: Christine Leteux's Albert Capellani: Cineaste du Romanesque, with a foreword by Kevin Brownlow.", "Leteux discovered Capellani in May of 2012, thanks to seeing Notre-Dame de Paris and Les Mis\u00e9rables at the Forum des Images in Paris.", "Setting out to learn more about the filmmaker, she realized how thoroughly his memory had nearly vanished from film history.", "She sought out and received the cooperation of his grandson, Bernard Basset-Capellani, whom she describes as \"intarissable\" (inexhaustible) on the subject.", "The result is a solid, traditional biography, with chapters mostly organized around the companies for which Capellani worked (Pathe, SCAGL, World, Mutual, and so on) and some of his key films (Les Mis\u00e9rables, The Red Lantern).", "The prose style is easily readable French, at least to someone like me with an average knowledge of the language.", "For an interview with Leteux concerning the book, see here.", "The book is on sale at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que's shop, which unfortunately does not sell online.", "It was supposed to be available on Amazon.fr, but so far is not.", "The easiest way for those outside France to order it is through three third-party book-sellers on amazon.fr, all offering it at the cover price of 14.90 \u20ac.", "Leteux's book is a vital source for anyone interested in early cinema.", "I was pleased to see that the last chapter ends with some quotations from my second entry on Capellani, ending with \"With the end of the main retrospective, however, it is safe to say that from now on anyone who claims to know early film history will need to be familiar with Capellani's work.\"", "The book includes a filmography and list of films available on DVD.", "These include a new one, a restoration of The Red Lantern by our friends at the Cinematek in Brussels, available on Amazon.fr or directly from the Cinematek's shop.", "The French-language historical journal on cinema, 1895, timed its March, 2013 issue to coincide with the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que's retrospective.", "It is entirely devoted to Capellani.", "I have not had a chance to see it yet, but the table of contents is available here.", "The only online purchasing source for individual issues I have found is here; the page gives a lengthy summary of the contents.", "Mariann continues to search for more surviving prints for restoration and eventual inclusion in future editions of Il Cinema Ritrovato.", "She has sent me some tantalizing news about recent discoveries and restorations.", "There will be a third Capellani season in 2014.", "This will probably include some of the director's American films: Social Hypocrites (now restored), Flash of the Emerald (the one surviving reel), Inside of the Cup (surviving but so far with no projection print), Eye for Eye (two surviving reals), Sisters, and the French film Le Nabab.", "Other possible restorations include House of Mirth, La belle limonadiere, and Oh Boy!", "A description of the 2013 Ritrovato festival is available here.", "Nanook and friends", "Early this year we posted our annual list of the ten best films of ninety years ago.", "It featured the classic early documentary, Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North.", "In March our friends at Flicker Alley released a two-disc Blu-ray edition of Nanook paired with the 1934 Danish feature, The Wedding of Palo (Palos Brudef\u00e6rd).", "The latter is one of those titles that one occasionally encounters on the fringes of older historical surveys, but it has been difficult indeed to see.", "This new print is a 2012 restoration from a George Eastman House original 35mm nitrate copy.", "Nanook is familiar enough, but The Wedding of Palo is not.", "It was made by the Danish explorer and anthropologist Knud Rasmussen, who appears in a brief introductory passage.", "Clearly he was influenced by Flaherty's work.", "He combines a simple fictional narrative with documentary scenes of traditional Inuit life in eastern Greenland.", "The basic story involves the heroine Navarona, whose brothers are reluctant to lose their housekeeper by allowing her to marry.", "Two men of the tribe court her and come into violent jealous conflict.", "Interjected are sequences of a salmon hunt, a festival, a traditional song duel between the two rivals, and a polar-bear hunt.", "The staged dialogue scenes involve sound recording, with no subtitles but the occasional brief intertitle to translate.", "As in Nanook, the non-professional actors are remarkably natural, especially the \"actress\" portraying the heroine.", "There is a cute young boy brought in at intervals for comic appeal, and the members of the village seem always to be laughing and enjoying a suspiciously carefree life.", "The film has the advantage of more spectacular scenery than that in Flaherty's film, with huge mountains and glaciers in place of the vast ice-covered vistas (see bottom image).", "As usual, the Flicker Alley team has gone beyond the call of duty with this release.", "It includes not only the two features, but six bonus films, as described in the press release:", "Nanook Revisited (Saumialuk) by Claude Massot was made in the same locations used by Flaherty.", "It shows how Inuit life changed in the intervening decades, how Flaherty consciously depicted a culture which was then already vanishing, and how Nanook is used today to teach the Inuit their heritage.", "Nanook Revisited was produced in 1988 on standard definition video for French television.", "Dwellings of the Far North (1928) is the igloo-building sequence of Nanook re-edited and re-titled as an educational film; Arctic Hunt (1913) and extended excerpts from Primitive Love (1927) are by Arctic explorer Frank E. Kleinschmidt; Eskimo Hunters of Northwest Alaska (1949) by Louis deRochemont shows many activities seen in Nanook thirty years after, and Face of the High Arctic (1959) depicts the ecology of the region, produced by the National Film Board of Canada.", "Altogether, the films run an impressive 281 minutes.", "There's also a booklet with excerpts from Flaherty's book, My Eskimo Friends, an essay by Lawrence Millman, \"Knud Rasmussen and The Wedding of Palo,\" and notes on the films.", "Snow White and the Seven (?) Bullfighting Dwarves", "In 2011, a French film, The Artist, gained huge attention in the infotainment media as a modern version of silent cinema, winning yet another Best Picture Oscar for the Weinstein brothers.", "It was a reasonably successful imitation of mid- to late 1920s cinema during the transition to sound.", "Now a much better modern silent film has arrived, Pablo Berger's Blancanieves, a loose version of the Snow White story transposed to 1920s Spain.", "A famous bullfighter is paralyzed after being gored in the ring.", "His wife dies in childbirth and his scheming nurse marries him.", "She keeps his daughter, Carmen, away from her father by setting her to work as a downtrodden servant in his country estate.", "Upon her father's death, the evil wife schemes to have her killed, and she escapes to the protection of a troupe of six bullfighting dwarves who, possessing uncertain arithmetic skills, bill themselves as seven bullfighting dwarves.", "While The Artist was a fairly good imitation of 1920s Hollywood filmmaking, Blancanieves is a pastiche of the 1928-29 era of European silent cinema.", "It draws on what I have termed the International Style of filmmaking, a late 1920s blend of influences from the French Impressionism, German Expressionism, and Soviet Montage movements.", "One could almost pass it off as a genuine film of the era.", "At times there are subjective effects \u00e0 la Impressionism.", "A superimposition conveys Carmen's memories of her father's crucial instructions to her, and superimposed images of hands waving handkerchiefs present the enthusiam of the crowd's plea for the bull to be pardoned.", "This was also the period in which the power of the wide angle lens, particularly in close-ups and in low-angle shots, was exploited, initially in Soviet cinema and then all over Europe.", "Blancanieves is full of such shots, as in the frame at the top of this entry and in these two shots from the opening scene:", "There are also montage sequences, building up to flurries of very short shots.", "This accelerated-editing technique is typical of both Soviet and French filmmaking of the era.", "The too-frequent use of handheld camera in Blancanieves detracts somewhat from the feeling of authenticity.", "In the late 1920s, cameras were too heavy to be handheld.", "They could be strapped to the body of the cinematographer with harnesses, but that creates a subtly different look.", "And during the late 1920s, shots with the camera holding on a character while the background spins around behind him or her would have been achieved by placing both camera and actor on a large turntable.", "(This effect apparently was pioneered in Germany in the mid-1920s).", "But the occasional dramatic lighting effects, particularly in the climactic scene, are distinctly reminiscent of German cinema.", "In general, the narrative is charming and amusing.", "The heroine's pet rooster provides exactly the sort of comic relief that is common in films of the 1920s, and the story has an effective fairy-tale quality.", "I found the ending a bit disappointing and certainly not typical of the films of the 1920s.", "Still, Berger has clearly watched an enormous number of 1920s European films and absorbed their styles.", "He can imitate the International Style remarkably well, telling a tale that is appropriate to the 1920s and yet has a touch of humor that doesn't belittle the silent era.", "Blancanieves was released in the US on March 29 and is currently making the rounds of art-houses and festivals.", "Other entries discussing the International Style and wide-angle filming at the end of the silent era can be found here and here.", "The Wedding of Palo", "Last Modified: Sunday | April 21, 2013 @ 20:29 open printable version", "This entry was posted", "on Sunday | April 21, 2013 at 8:29 pm and is filed under Art cinema, Directors: Capellani, Documentary film, Film comments, Film history, National cinemas: Denmark, National cinemas: Spain and Portugal, Silent film.", "Responses are currently closed, but you can trackback from", "your own site", "Comments are closed.", "have comments", "about the state of this website?", "go here"], "meta": {"id": "test04394", "claim_title": "The Inside of the Cup", "claim_section": "Film adaptation.", "claim_context": "In January 1921 a film adaptation of the novel was released, directed by Albert Capellani, and featuring William P.
