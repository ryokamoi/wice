Recording sessions ran from late June to early September. The sessions, largely the work of Howerdel, Keenan, and Freese, contained contributions from past and present members of the band, including Lenchantin, Lohner, White, and Iha. Keenan, aware of the time constraints and Howerdel's future intentions on doing solo albums, also encouraged Howerdel to contribute lead vocals to about a third of the album. A wide variety of different songs were chosen to be recorded, from Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" to Led Zeppelin's \"When the Levee Breaks\". Most songs were radical reinterpretations of the original, sometimes unrecognizable compared to the originals. Howerdel explained that it was done on purpose, to make the song's their own, and conceded that he, as of 2010, still had not even once ever heard the original version of Crucifix's \"Annihilation\", another song re-recorded for the album. He also stated that some songs had started as original A Perfect Circle songs musically, until the band decided to use the lyrics of other songs over the compositions, in turn converting them into cover songs."}}

As a result of this act, two acres of land were purchased from Philemon Armstrong, at a cost of 5,000 pounds of tobacco. Upon this tract, the same plot upon which the present Talbot County Court House now stands, the court house, a brick building 20 x 30 feet, was erected at a cost of 115,000 pounds of tobacco. The courts of the county were held in this building from 1712 until 1794. A tavern to accommodate those who attended court was one of the first buildings erected; stores and dwellings followed. The village was then known as \"Talbot Court House\". These were not the first buildings in the area. The frame meeting house of the Society of Friends was built between 1682 and 1684. The Wye plantation was settled in the 1650's by Welsh Puritan and wealthy planter Edward Lloyd and is owned and occupied by the 11th generation of that family."}}

It was the fourth season to feature entirely returning players, following \"Survivor: All-Stars\", \"Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains\", and \"Survivor: Cambodia\" and was the 11th season overall to feature returning players. This season introduced several alterations to the game format. The process for resolving a tied vote was changed for this season, removing the second ballot where only non-tied castaways were allowed to vote between the tied castaways and proceeding directly to the procedure to resolve a deadlocked tie: an open deliberation between non-tied voters."}}

In this role he oversaw the design and construction of the mail ship \"SS Governor Blackall\", personally commissioned for the Queensland government by the Premier Charles Lilley in 1869. The Sydney-built but Queensland-owned ship was an attempt to break what was later described as the \"capricious monopoly\" of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company on coastal trade and mail delivery from England. However, it ultimately caused the political downfall of Lilley as he had undertaken the contract without consulting his colleagues. \n Selfe left Mort's in 1877 to practise as a consulting engineer at 141 Pitt Street, gaining a reputation for versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884\u201385, where he visited engineering works and technical education facilities in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe set up a new office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street.

Electronic Arts.", "### Electronic Arts and Deluxe Paint", "EA founder Trip Hawkins poses with an Amiga 1000", "Those who have firsthand experience with the modern Electronic Arts typically know it as a faceless corporate behemoth, infamous for absorbing, then strangling independent development teams, eliminating competition by paying for exclusive rights to major sports leagues, and working its employees beyond the breaking point.", "They may be surprised to find out that EA originally had quite a different mission and philosophy.", "EA's founder, Trip Hawkins, was actually fighting against the poor treatment of programmers that he witnessed elsewhere in the industry.", "When he launched Electronic Arts in 1982, he envisioned an environment where developers and game designers would be treated like rock stars: promoted in major media, given generous royalties, and allowed to explore wherever their imagination and talent led them.", "Hawkins saw the Amiga as a groundbreaking platform, a brand new canvas that would let his developers create great new works of art.", "In November 1985, he took out a two-page ad in Compute! magazine that extolled the Amiga's virtues and promised that Electronic Arts would be supporting the platform for a whole new generation of games.", "\"I believe this machine, marketed and supported properly, should have a very significant impact on the personal computer industry,\" Hawkins said prophetically in an earlier interview in the same magazine.", "EA's first Amiga product, however, wasn't a game at all, but a game development tool.", "Programmer Dan Silva had been working on an internal graphics editor that was code-named Prism.", "When the Amiga was released, he quickly reworked the program to take advantage of the new computer's stunning graphics capabilities.", "Even before it shipped, Silva was already working on the next version, which would contain many more advanced features.", "This program was Deluxe Paint, and it launched the careers of thousands of computer graphic artists.", "With a simple interface featuring a toolbar on the right-hand side of the screen, Deluxe Paint was a powerful tool that could create not only static graphics, but also animation.", "This made it perfect for creating images for computer and video games, and for a long time Deluxe Paint was the industry standard for creating art for this medium, much like tools such as 3D Studio Max are today.", "Even years later, as the PC gaming market began to eclipse the Amiga in terms of sheer size and number of titles, many game development studios still made their art using Deluxe Paint.", "Its native format, IFF, and animation format, IFF ANIM, are still supported by many graphics packages today.", "IFF ANIM files were compressed using delta encoding, resulting in smaller files.", "This was nearly 10 years before animation compression standards such as MPEG were released.", "But back in 1986, the combination of an Amiga and Deluxe Paint was unbeatable.", "While Adobe's Photoshop on the Macintosh platform would eventually become the standard tool for creating two-dimensional graphic images, the Mac was still a monochrome-only computer at this point, and the PC could barely manage four colors even with a CGA graphics card.", "Again, the Amiga was ahead of its time.", "The cover art for the Deluxe Paint II box featured an image of Tutankhamen that had been created inside the program itself.", "This image quickly became an iconic picture in the computer graphics industry.", "Even Commodore recognized the power of Deluxe Paint, using the Tutankhamen image on a new full-page ad that\u2014finally!\u2014stated the Amiga's advantages outright.", "Commodore Amiga ad, circa 1986.", "Image courtesy The Commodore Billboard",

TITLE: Sega-16 \u2013 Quad Challenge", "### Genesis Reviews", "# Quad Challenge", "October 10, 2011 at 8:00 amKen Horowitz0 comments", "Genre: Racing Developer: Namco Publisher: Namco Players: 1-2 Released: 1991", "It's surprising that there aren't more racing games involving all-terrain vehicles (ATV).", "One would think that racing over dunes and through mud would appeal to more people, but apparently that isn't the case.", "Relatively few titles have been released over the past two decades, and the most successful series of the bunch, MX vs. ATV was recently discontinued by THQ and its development studio closed.", "It seems that off-road racing has been hit as hard by the economy as everyone else.", "The truth is though, that the ATV genre has never really managed to gain a foothold in mainstream gaming.", "The granddaddy of ATV games, Namco's Quad Challenge, was most likely the first of its kind on consoles, and it didn't exactly set the world on fire.", "While everyone else was racing Sega's Ferrari or motor cycle, or competing in the Monaco GP, relatively few seemed interested in taking control of an ATV.", "The game was quietly released, and while sales figures are elusive, it doesn't appear that the game was a major hit for Namco.", "A game's success or failure at retail isn't necessarily dependent on quality, of course, and we've all seen horrible titles sell millions while true gems collect dust in bargain bins.", "The latter is all the more tragic, since many people complaining of a lack of good games in a certain category are missing out on titles that would most likely satisfy them.", "Even if they are counseled to play the great ones they've missed, they often don't.", "Those titles that are merely lackluster do far worse, since no one recommends them, and most gamers tend to pick them up on eBay or at flea markets for mere pennies on the dollar.", "These are the games that provoke a sense of indifference, that feeling of \"it's not that good, but it was cheap.\"", "Namco's 1991 racer Quad Challenge falls squarely into this category.", "I'm willing to take into account the fact that Quad Challenge was a forerunner in its genre.", "There weren't that many ATV games around at the time, and there were certainly none on the Genesis.", "It would be unfair to cite it for lacking features that later ATV games incorporated or even the more complex graphics and features of arcade ATV games had, like Four Trax (the 1989 game on which Quad Challenge is based).", "No, if we're going to scrutinize here, it should be on Quad Challenge's lack of the fundamental qualities that make a racing game fun.", "There's no way around that, since there was plenty of Genesis racing titles out by 1991.", "At a glance, things seem to be off to a great start.", "There are two modes of gameplay, practice and championship, each with a specific set of courses.", "Practice mode lets players race on nine tracks, and championship ups the limit to a whopping 16.", "Two players can compete against each other, and there are four different ATVs from which to choose, each with varying degrees of acceleration, horsepower, and handling.", "Personally, I never really noticed any difference among them aside from the color one chooses at the beginning of the race, and that is essentially the limit of customization.", "That's a far cry from the original mode in Sega's Super Hang-On, which lets players customize their bikes by using race winnings to purchase different upgrades.", "There's a password system for championship mode, but it does little more than save your progress in the championship, as nothing else changes while you play.", "That's probably why it's a mere four characters long.", "Could bike upgrades be responsible for Super Hang-On's massive passwords, causing Namco to keep Quad Challenge as a strictly arcade racer in order to make the player's life easier?", "I suppose one can attempt to justify it, but the really bare bones workings of this game really hurt its long-term playability.", "Racing always takes place in split-screen mode, regardless of whether or not there's a second player.", "This is kind of distracting, and it doesn't really seem to be necessary.", "Do I really need half the screen to know where my opponent is on the track?", "Isn't that what the course map on the right is for?", "Races are also timed, and completing a lap extends the timer, similar to OutRun.", "Courses are mostly comprised of turns and minor bumps, and there is little variety to them.", "One simply goes around the track, shifting and braking when necessary, but the racing is perhaps the only thing in the game that bears mentioning.", "Taking turns to sharply can lead to a wipeout, so players must learn to master the correct technique of braking when turning.", "The bikes can also overheat if they're pressed too long, so down-shifting at the right time is vital.", "This was a pleasant change for me, as most other racers of the era consist of just hitting the accelerator and occasionally braking.", "Success seems to come mostly from learning the track layout.", "Quad Challenge adds the element of knowing one's vehicle, as no knowledge of turns and bumps is going to save a bike that's overheating.", "While Quad Challenge makes a minor effort to stand out from the crowd in gameplay, it plays it safe with its presentation.", "There's no way it could mimic the smooth scaling of its arcade sibling, and the track sides have been noticeably stripped down to make things easier on the engine.", "Aside from the occasional bush or sign, there's nothing but dirt to look at.", "The tracks themselves are pretty plain as well, and only a change in the distant background makes distinguishing them possible.", "I do think that Namco copied Nintendo's own Excitebike when it designed the racers, since they look almost identical.", "Even the wipeout roll is the same!", "They at least animate fluidly, which is what Super Hang-On was really lacking (that leaning animation\u2026 egad!).", "The only part of the whole package that I really like is the music, which features that great early '90s Namco flair, similar to Burning Force.", "It's very clear and catchy, and gives the player something to focus on instead of the uninspired visuals.", "In the end, there's not a lot of traction on this ATV's tires, which may turn off gamers looking for a deeper racing experience.", "There's fun to be had here, especially with a second player, but that doesn't last too long due to the repetitive tracks and dull gameplay.", "I know I keep comparing Quad Challenge to Sega's motorcycle classic, but Namco should really have copied Super Hang-On's original mode.", "That would have breathed new life into this game and made it a classic.", "Those looking for a great arcade racer should stick to that one or just play OutRun; it looks as great as it plays.", "I guess we would have to wait a few more years for Namco to finally emulate Sega's gaming formula.", "Perhaps it should have waited until then to bring this ATV racer home.", "## SCORE: 6 out of 10", "Discuss this review in our forum.",

spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The redback spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the redback spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live on the periphery of the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating. \n After mating sperm is stored in the spermathecae, organs of the female reproductive tract, and can be used up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac."}}

The Wachowskis claimed no influence regarding \"Dark City\", but commented about it and \"The Truman Show\" that they thought it was \"very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of reality.\". \n Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series \"The Invisibles\"; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film. The Wachowskis responded that they enjoy the comic but did not use it for inspiration. \n In addition, the similarity of the films' central concept to a device in the long-running series \"Doctor Who\" has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial \"The Deadly Assassin\") is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality."}}

and 80s.", "Their age location in history sandwiches them awkwardly between two better-known generations: They were born just too late to be World War II heroes and just too early to be New Age firebrands.", "In their personal lives, this age location has been a source of tension.", "By the time the Silent were entering midlife, they spearheaded the divorce revolution and popularized (thanks, Gail Sheehy) the term \"midlife crisis.\"", "But in their economic lives, this age location has been very good to them\u2014and given them a lifetime ride on the up-escalator coming off the American High.", "The Silent started out as the children of crisis.", "They grew up while older people were fighting wars and making great sacrifices on their behalf.", "Childrearing in America, already more protective for the G.I.s, approached the point of suffocation.", "When the Silent began coming of age after World War II, they tiptoed cautiously in a post-crisis social order that no one wanted to disturb.", "Unlike the G.I.s, they rarely talked about \"changing the system,\" but instead about \"working within the system.\"", "Because they didn't want anything to go on their \"permanent records\" and kept their heads down during the McCarthy era, Time gave them the label \"Silent\" in a famous 1951 essay.", "They were also careful in the labor market.", "Fortune's story on the \"College Class of '49\" was subtitled \"Taking No Chances.\"", "When they went to job interviews, their first questions were about pension plans.", "They emulated their powerful G.I. elders by

to end.", "A new \"booming\" economy was ready to join right out of school.", "Demographer Richard Easterlin, in his 1980 book Birth and Fortune, called them the \"Lucky\" or \"Fortunate\" generation for their great timing.", "Easterlin noted that a remarkable feature of the Sputnik era was how the typical young man could earn more by age 30 than the average wage for men of all ages in his profess\u00adion\u2014and could certainly live better than most \"retired\" elders.", "He also noted that since the mid-1970s, the economic conditions facing young late-wave Boomers were becoming much tougher.", "At the time, Easterlin hypothesized that the Silent\u2014being small in number due to low birthrates during the 1930s and early '40s\u2014benefited from labor markets that bid up their wages in an era when young adults were relatively scarce.", "Later, as they retired, their small size (next to the large FICA-paying generation following them) has certainly helped make their pay-as-you-go Social Security and Medicare benefits seem more affordable.", "Sociologist Elwood Carlson echoes Easterlin's thesis in his recent book, The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom.", "Yet the arrival of young-adult Gen Xers in the 1980s and '90s, who were also small in number but have fared miserably in the economy (a topic I'll explore in a later column), throws this explanation into doubt.", "Numbers helped, but what helped the Silent even more was, again, their timing.", "Taught to play by the rules, this generation discovered at every age\u2014from the moment they married (at a median age of 21 in 1960) and purchased a house and car (soon thereafter)\u2014that playing by the rules always worked well for them.", "Real Median Family Income by Cohort: Silent Generation", "As the Silent have aged, their perfect timing has not let them down.", "Many of them locked in fixed 3% mortgages on their first homes in the 1960s just before inflation hit\u2014giving them decades of negative real interest rates.", "In the large corporations where so many of them worked, they signed up young for the defined-benefit pension plans their G.I. managers started\u2014the same plans that are now unraveling for Boomers.", "Their midlife high-savings decades roughly coincided, in 1980s and '90s, with perhaps the greatest bull market ever in both stocks and bonds.", "And after riding this bull, the Silent retired and sold out just before the crash hit.", "The last Silent cohort reached age 65 in 2007.", "Bingo.", "This is the only living generation that could half-believe, along with Woody Allen, that \"80 percent of life is just showing up,\" a joke that makes most Xers simply shake their heads.", "In terms of national leadership, the Silent\u2014unlike the G.I.s\u2014are not a powerful generation.", "According to the late management guru Warren Bennis, they redefined leadership as more \"maestro\" than \"macho.\"", "They are the only generation in American history never to occupy the White House.", "In Presidents, we jumped from George Bush Sr., the World War II veteran, to Baby Boomer Bill Clinton.", "Yet they are without doubt the healthiest and most educated generation of elders that ever lived\u2014and, of course, the wealthiest.", "Coming of age fifty years ago, they quickly amassed more wealth than the seniors of that era.", "(Back in the early 1960s, the elderly were poorer than young adults by most measures.)", "In 2010, for the first time, the median net worth of households age 75+ ($228,400) is higher than

along with their instinct to help others in need, the Silent as elders have become economic anchors for America's new renaissance in multigenerational family living.", "Many routinely pay for extended-family vacations or subsidize their grown Boomer or Xer kids.", "Many have set up college trust funds for their grandkids\u2014and indeed, a record share have assumed formal custody of them.", "Most are worried about the economic challenges facing their families\u2014and wonder why success has become so much harder for them.", "Neil Howe", "Neil Howe is a historian, economist, and

rarely left London, Petiver ran a global network of dozens of ship surgeons and captains who collected animal and plant specimens for him in far-flung colonies.", "Petiver set up a museum and research center with those specimens, and he and visiting scientists wrote papers that other naturalists (including Carl Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy) drew on.", "Between one-quarter and one-third of

Britain, which in the 1700s boasted the world's biggest and most powerful fleets, had adventurous scientists and collectors, and was a major participant in the slave trade.", "Spain controlled most of

voyage across the ocean.", "The surgeons were scientifically educated, she says, and had plenty of free time at ports such as Cartagena, in modern Colombia, and Portobelo, in modern Panama, while their fellow crew members sold slaves and provisioned the ships.", "Petiver usually supplied recruits with kits that included jars for insects and brown paper for pressing plants.", "Compensation included books, medicines, and cash.", "Strikingly, some naturalists also instructed their contacts abroad to train slaves as collectors.", "Slaves often knew about specimens that Europeans didn't and visited areas that Europeans wouldn't.", "Those slaves virtually never got credit for their work, though Petiver did offer to pay them a half-crown ($18 today) for every dozen insects or 12 pence ($7) for every dozen plants.", "Petiver never collected overseas himself, but some scientists did, and they often found themselves in morally compromising positions.", "Henry Smeathman, an idealistic English naturalist, sailed for a slave colony in Sierra Leone in December 1771 and collected for the likes of Joseph Banks, an adviser to King George and longtime president of the Royal Society.", "Among other activities, Smeathman studied the massive termite mounds in western Africa, which stand up to 4 meters high.", "He had rollicking adventures breaking the mounds open and fending off

Flycatcher: Natural History, Slavery, and Empire in the Late Eighteenth Century, by historian Deirdre Coleman of the University of Melbourne in Australia, Smeathman began his journey as a foe of slavery, vowing to tell the truth about \"those little-known and much misrepresented people, the Negroes.\"", "And as a scientist, he considered himself superior to the ignorant, crude slavers he encountered in Sierra Leone.", "(For their part, the slavers thought him barmy for coming all the way to Africa to hunt for bugs and weeds.)", "But Smeathman was utterly dependent on those men for food, protection, and transportation.", "He also got lonely and started to socialize with them, playing whist and backgammon and even golf on a rugged, two-hole course on an offshore island.", "Soon he was hunting goats and enjoying grog-soaked feasts on the beach with the slavers.", "By 1774, he was working for a slaving company based in Liverpool because it greased the wheels for shipping specimens; he even started to trade slaves in exchange for supplies for his expeditions.", "Bit by bit, compromise by compromise, Smeathman became part of the system he once despised.", "Smeathman and others also relied on slavers to haul their precious specimens to Great Britain, packing them onto the same ships as enslaved Africans.", "(Few ships sailed straight back to Europe from Africa, so most specimens reached England via the Caribbean.)", "Perhaps not surprisingly, given how they treated their human cargo, the ships' crews had a spotty record in caring for fragile bugs, plants, and animal skins.", "If the sunlight, heat, humidity, and saltwater didn't destroy the specimens, the worms, ants, and rodents onboard usually did.", "Careless sailors might also smash the specimens by accident or for sport.", "Of the items that arrived safely in England, naturalists were most excited about exotic finds such as ostrich eggs, Goliath beetles, butterflies, sloths, and armadillos.", "But the real treasures, Murphy writes, were drugs such as cinchona bark, which contains quinine, and dyes such as deep-blue indigo and bright-red cochineal.", "The latter, which is extracted from beetles, was worth more per ounce than silver.", "Scientific studies of drugs and dyes often opened new opportunities for slave traders.", "Merchants eagerly sought natural resources to exploit abroad and consulted scientists about the best way to hunt for and cultivate them.", "Quinine and other drugs gleaned from tropical locales, Murphy notes, also helped Europeans survive there.", "And the safer and more profitable a colony was, the more its commercial activity, including slavery, thrived, creating new demand for slaves.", "Scientific research, then, not only depended on colonial slavery, but enabled it and helped expand its reach.", "## The tainted origins of many cabinets of curiosity", "Of all the scientific fields, natural history benefited most from the slave trade, especially botany and entomology.", "One disciple of Linnaeus reported collecting three species new to science within 15 minutes on his first excursion in Sierra Leone.", "The bounty of plants astounded him.", "Doctors affiliated with slavery also collected human remains.", "\"The trade in natural curiosities was widespread, and body parts were definitely part of that,\" says Carolyn Roberts, a historian of science and assistant professor of African American studies at Yale University who's writing a book about the slave trade and medicine.", "\"Doctors would send things to Britain, especially if they had a case they found interesting.\"", "Examples of interesting items included polyps cut from the hands of slaves, patches of dried skin, a fetus taken after a miscarriage, and, according to one old catalog, \"stones extracted from the vagina of a negro African girle.\"", "Those bugs and plants and bits of human beings often ended up in wealthy gentlemen's \"cabinets of curiosity,\" jammed next to Roman coins and gems and whatever else tickled their fancy.", "Other specimens landed in universities or scholarly institutes.", "Newton himself, who's really the paradigm figure of an isolated, nontraveling, sitting-at-his-desk genius, had access to numbers he wouldn't have had access to without the Atlantic slave trade.", "Some historians now refer to those private and institutional collections as the \"big science\" of their day.", "Scholars studied those centralized repositories and then circulated accounts of their research to other scientists.", "Linnaeus drew on such accounts when putting together Systema Naturae in 1735, the book that introduced his famous binomial naming system for flora and fauna.", "A few physical sciences also piggybacked on the slave trade.", "Slave labor built the first major observatory in the Southern Hemisphere, in Cape Town, South Africa.", "Astronomers such as Edmond Halley solicited observations of the moon and stars from slave ports, and geologists collected rocks and minerals there.", "Even a field as rarefied as celestial mechanics benefited from slavery.", "When developing his theory of gravity, Newton studied ocean tides, knowing that the gravitational tug of the moon causes them.", "Newton needed tide readings from all over the globe, and one crucial set of readings came from French slave ports in Martinique.", "Delbourgo says, \"Newton himself, who's really the paradigm figure of an isolated, nontraveling, sitting-at-his-desk genius, had access to numbers he wouldn't have had access to without the Atlantic slave trade.\"", "## Museums grapple with the past", "Many natural history specimens with ties to the slave trade eventually ended up in museums.", "When Petiver died in 1718, a fellow naturalist in London named Hans Sloane snapped up his collection.", "Sloane had collected on slave plantations in Jamaica, and he married into a slaving family whose money enabled more collecting.", "In 1727, he succeeded Newton as president of the Royal Society (which itself invested in slaving companies).", "When Sloane died in 1753, he willed his collection, including Petiver's goods, to the British government, and it became the foundation of the British Museum in London.", "The museum later split into several entities.", "Many of Sloane's specimens went to the Natural History Museum, where they remain today.", "Specimens collected through the slave trade also ended up at the Oxford University Herbaria, Royal Society, and Chelsea Physic Garden, among other places, Murphy reports.", "Representatives for those institutes say it's difficult to put numbers on how many of their specimens have ties to slavery.", "In some cases, they haven't gone through and digitized the records yet, and many old specimens have vague or fragmentary records anyway, making their provenance obscure.", "But documents from the 18th and 19th centuries attest to thousands upon thousands of items pouring into Europe.", "Smeathman alone sent 600 species of plants and 710 species of insects back to England, often with several individuals per species.", "(One of Smeathman's patrons complained about the glut of bugs, writing that Smeathman had sent too many to unpack: \"My House could not possibly contain one half.\")", "And although many old specimens have either disintegrated or been lost, at least some with ties to slavery probably survive in almost every institute in Europe with natural history collections dating back a few centuries.", "In addition to his own collecting, Hans Sloane (pictured) bought up the collections of other naturalists, many of whom used slave ships to reach far-flung places.", "When Sloane died in 1753, his specimens became the founding collection of the British Museum.", "They later ended up in London's Natural History Museum.", "NHM IMAGES", "Those collections aren't just antiquarian curiosities.", "Scientists still consult them to construct phylogenies and do taxonomic work: Many of the collections contain type specimens, the first described individual of a species against which all other individuals are compared.", "The collections are also invaluable for studying plant domestication, historic climate change, and shifts in geographical distributions of species.", "Scientists have even extracted DNA from specimens to study how plants and animals have evolved across the centuries.", "Most scientists, however, remain unaware of the origins of the collections.", "\"Very few people think about how [specimens] were collected, whether they were collected through slave trade routes or otherwise,\" says Stephen Harris, a curator at the Oxford University Herbaria, which houses some of Sloane's goods.", "\"They're simply data points.\"", "In an email, Mark Carine, a curator at the Natural History Museum, noted that institutions such as his have a broader role than just preserving specimens.", "\"As curators, we have a responsibility not only to care for our collections and make them available for research but also to facilitate an understanding of their significance and relevance today.\"", "He adds that Sloane's collection \"is not simply a biological record; it is also a resource for understanding the social and historical context within which science developed, and we are certainly keen to continue working with researchers across disciplines to better understand this.\"", "Still, Murphy and Delbourgo say that even some curators are oblivious to the histories of their collections, and Murphy encountered one who dismissed her work outright.", "Delbourgo emphasizes that his historical research \"isn't an attack on museums\" and that he knows museum staff are often \"under-resourced and overworked.\"", "But, he adds, \"Museums have been bad\" about acknowledging the dubious origins of many items.", "\"They have dragged their feet enormously.\"", "Now that the link between early science and slavery has come to light, an important question remains: What should scientists do about it?", "Historians say acknowledgment is a start: In research papers, scientists should mention how specimens were gathered.", "Taking the origin of specimens into account can also improve the research itself, especially given the paucity of collecting records in some cases.", "For example, Murphy mentions that the slave trade can help explain the geographic distributions of certain specimens.", "African plants, for instance, wouldn't have been collected from all over the continent, but from specific points along the coast\u2014the ports where countries were shipping slaves.", "\"From a scientific point of view, your specimen is essentially a piece of evidence,\" Harris adds, \"and the more you know about the provenance of that piece of evidence and the better understanding you have \u2026 the better you can use it within your analyses.\"", "The connections between science and the slave trade could also feed into ongoing debates about reparations and the historical legacies of slavery.", "Like some U.K. organizations, U.S. universities such as Yale, Georgetown, and Brown have acknowledged how they benefited from slavery.", "For the most part, Murphy says, those conversations are framed \"in terms of just dollars and cents, pounds and pence.", "Yet [the profits] can also clearly be measured in specimens collected and papers published.\"", "Overall, she says, \"Modern science and the transatlantic slave trade were two of the most important factors in the shaping of the modern world.\"", "Historians are finally recognizing that they shaped each other as well.", "As Delbourgo says, \"We've been so negligent in bringing these histories [of slavery and science] together.", "We've missed that they are in fact the same history.\"", "## Got a tip?", "How to contact the news team", "## ScienceInsider", "##

New Order Amish would best be considered a subgroup of the Old Order Amish.", "The New Order Amish could be described as more progressive than Old Order Amish in some ways, but more conservative in others.", "### New Order Amish share numerous similarities with Old Order Amish:", "plain dress-New Order Amish dress plainly, though may wear more colorful clothinghorse-and-buggy travel-New Order

vary, New Order Amish are also careful about which technologies they accept", "At the same time, New Order Amish differentiate themselves from Old Order Amish in key ways.", "### Differences between New Order Amish and Old Order Amish include:", "greater openness to telephones in the home-some New Order Amish permit phone lines in the homemore mission-oriented outlook-New Order Amish print their beliefs in pamphlets and may travel abroad for missions workgenerally shorter beards and hair-New Order Amish are more likely to trim hair shorterprofession of assurance of salvation\u2013 New Order Amish hold the belief that one can know the state of his soul while on earth, in contrast to the \"living hope\" of salvation more common among Old Order Amish", "New Order Amish are against the production and use of tobacco and alcohol", "prohibition of alcohol and tobacco-New Order Amish are strict about substance use and promote \"clean\" youth experiences", "air travel-many New Order Amish allow travel by airplane, unlike Old Order Amishmore elaborate buggies-buggies may have rubber tires and decorative moldingSunday School and Bible study-Old Order Amish generally do not hold formal Bible study meetingsLower retention rate-a lower percentage of New Order youth choose to join the Amish church", "### Origins of the New Order Amish", "The New Order Amish originate from a pair of movements in Ohio and Pennsylvania in the 1960s.", "The key driving factors in the Ohio schism were twofold\u2013one was a belief that controversial practices such as tobacco and alcohol use should be eliminated, and that \"clean\" courtship should be implemented for youth (as opposed to the practice of bundling found among some Amish).", "Secondly, reformist Amish wished to introduce a more evangelical element into the church, concerning personal salvation and mission work.", "Amish in this group felt strongly about assurance of salvation, Sunday School, and church outreach.", "The division which occurred in 1966 in Lancaster County shared some similarities with the Ohio division, but was more focused on technology.", "New Order Amish are less commonly known as the \"Amish Brotherhood\".", "Currently, the largest New Order community is found in the Holmes County settlement, consisting of 18 church districts, while the Lancaster County settlement contains just one or two districts.", "There is also a spin-off group found in Holmes County known as the New Order Christian Fellowship, or New New Order.", "### Where do New Order Amish live?", "Nearly 20 New Order Amish church districts are found in Holmes County, Ohio, near the towns of Berlin, Sugarcreek, and elsewhere", "New Order Amish churches can be found in a number of states, with the largest population centered in Holmes County, Ohio, home to 18 church districts.", "Other New Order communities can be found in approximately a dozen states, including Indiana, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina", "New Order Amish are Plain too", "Despite what the name might seem to imply, the New Order Amish share many of the same cultural traits as the Old Order.", "They drive buggies (albeit ones which may be slightly fancier), wear plain clothing (sometimes with more colorful fabrics and for men, more-neatly trimmed beards and hair), speak Pennsylvania Dutch, and generally do not have public electricity in the home.", "New Order homes and barns are similar in appearance to those of Old Order Amish.", "New Order Amish buggies may have decorative fronts", "New Order Amish may be confused with the Beachy Amish, a group which is theologically similar to the Old Order Amish but which accepts a higher degree of technology, including cars.", "### Do New Order Amish use more technology?", "New Order Amish may be more accepting of certain technologies such as phones in the home.", "Amish researchers Hurst and McConnell note that \"the differences in technology use between the Old Order and the New Order are relatively minor\" (Paradox, Hurst/McConnell, p.52).", "Hurst and McConnell also state that car ownership among Old Order youth is more common, as is cell phone usage among Old Order church members.", "Unlike the Old Order, New Order Amish generally do not have any restrictions on air travel, and sometimes use this form of transportation for business or vacation travel.", "### New Order Amish beliefs on Assurance of salvation", "One theological difference is the belief in assurance of salvation.", "Just like other Christians, Amish interpret the idea of salvation differently.", "New Order Amish are among those who see evidence for assurance of being saved, as opposed to the more common belief of a \"living hope\" of salvation seen among most Amish.", "There has been some melding of this view with some Old Order districts in Holmes County in particular, and some of the Old Order districts have come to share similar views on this issue.", "Clean courtship", "Another key issue is that of courtship standards for young people.", "New Order Amish believe strongly in clean courtship, and as detailed above, this was part of the impetus for the Ohio group to break from the Old Order churches.", "In recent times, other Amish, including those from the Old Order have been sympathetic to this view as well.", "For that matter, \"bundling\" (the practice of a courting couple lying together, clothed, on a bed) is confined more to the more conservative Amish groups.", "Alcohol and tobacco", "Another area where the New Order Amish are generally 'cleaner' than the Old Order Amish as a whole is tobacco and alcohol.", "Though numerous Old Order Amish are against involvement with tobacco, some Old Order Amish do grow and even use tobacco.", "New Order Amish universally see this as morally wrong and have come out strongly against it.", "New Order Amish feel that tobacco is destructive to the body, and something that Christians should not be involved in, either in personal use or in producing it for others.", "New Order Amish take similar views on the use of alcohol, which is used, usually in moderation, by some Amish.", "Sunday school", "Another distinguishing marker is Sunday School.", "Most but not all New Order Amish have Sunday school, involving both adults and children, on the \"off\" Sunday (the alternating Sunday when a given district does not hold church service).", "Similarly to an Amish church service, this will take place in a congregant family's home, and will involve some singing as well as reading, with each member taking turns reading a few passages.", "There will also be discussion of the reading, with commentary led by the ministers.", "New Order Amish may have songbooks in both English and German, allowing outsiders to participate.", "Songs are typically faster and more contemporary than those sung from the Ausbund.", "Sunday School is followed by a fellowship meal, like the one that follows church service.", "Old Order Amish use this \"off\" day as a chance to visit relatives or other churches, as well as time for Bible reading and devotions in the home.", "However they have generally not seen the need to devote a formal period to Bible study in the form of Sunday School.", "Organized Sunday school meetings are another way in which New Order Amish resemble more evangelical strains of Christianity.", "### New Order Amish may be more open to outsiders", "In keeping with their somewhat evangelical bent, New Order Amish tend to be more open to outsiders.", "Old Order Amish of course welcome outsiders into their services as the New Order do, but New Order Amish will be more likely to deliver at least part of the sermon in English.", "Some New Order Amish churches, particularly one North Carolina congregation at Yanceyville (now defunct) have attracted a large number of Amish seekers, resulting in a high percentage of members from outside the ethnic body of Amish.", "New Order Amish maintain many similarities with Old Order Amish, including plain dress", "Other New Order Amish are likely to be involved in mission work and even to travel longer distances, owing to the allowance on plane travel.", "Some New Order Amish youth have been involved in teaching English to Old Colony Mennonites in Mexico, for example, while others have done mission work in places as far away as Asia.", "Generally the New Order tends to be more oriented to the world and more accessible to the \"seeker\" community.", "This greater willingness to engage the world is even evident in the publishing sphere.", "The most obvious example is Ohio bishop David Kline, who has published two books on nature and sustainable agriculture, as well as a small farming magazine which has a substantial audience among non-Amish.", "New Order Amish keep a lower percentage of children in the faith", "Statistics show that New Order Amish tend to keep a lower percentage of their children in the faith, somewhere around two-thirds (in comparison to the 80-90% or higher retention rate of other Amish afffiliations).", "This may be because of greater openness to the world through their outreach orientation, and an ideology more closely resembling \"higher\" churches.", "At least partially for this reason, some criticize the New Order Amish as \"Beachy Amish without the cars\".", "New Order and Old Order Amish disagree less today than in the past", "New Order and Old Order Amish are cut from similar cloth and share much in common, including a similar approach to technology, use of horse-and-buggy for travel, and plain dress.", "While the New Order Amish may be considered more \"progressive\" on certain matters of theology, missionary work, and evangelical outlook, and some technology (in some cases), they may be seen as more \"conservative\" when it comes to issues like courtship, alcohol and tobacco, certain technologies such as the cell phone, and in retaining farming as an occupation, which they do at a slightly higher percentage than members of Old Order churches.", "Inside a New Order Amish clothing business", "There have been and continue to be substantial disagreements between the two groups.", "Old Order Amish may see the New Order as taking a holier-than-thou attitude, and being too forward in their assertions about religion, particularly concerning assurance of salvation.", "Hurst and McConnell find that the most common criticism is that New Order churches \"are unstable because their young people are more likely to be lost to other Anabaptist churches\".", "New Order Amish may find fault with Old Order Amish for being too lenient concerning youth behavior, or too reliant on tradition over spiritual truth.", "At the same time, in recent years both sides have begun to see more eye-to-eye on certain issues, particularly in Holmes County, where the two groups live side-by-side and cooperate in many spheres.", "Hurst and McConnell note that \"a sizable number of Old Order individuals, including church leaders, are quite attracted to the New Order positions on both spirituality and control of the youth.\"", "There is also a degree of openness to the idea of assurance of salvation among Old Orders.", "The Amish have a long history of schism, resulting in groups such as the New Order Amish as well as more conservative affiliations such as the Andy Weaver Amish church and the Swartzentruber Amish.", "However, today many Amish seek to play down differences, seeing past church splits as painful parts of their history, while emphasizing common ground.", "For further information, see:", "An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community, Charles E.

The metropolitan area, at nearly 10 million people, is the third-largest in the United States. \n Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan, Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, the city made a concerted effort to rebuild. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900 Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world. Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including new construction styles (including the Chicago School of architecture), the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed skyscraper. Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, technology, telecommunications, and transportation."}}

Launched on 22 March 2014, the petition had attracted over 1,700 signatures by 7 April. The council's Head of Infrastructure had responded that no funding was available to stabilise the coastline and that it would cost a significant amount of money to rebuild the steps. Clare Sutton and the local Green Party organised a public meeting in August 2014 and appealed to the local community to form a pressure group to reopen the steps. The Friends of Castle Cove Beach was formed, with the group becoming a charity three years later. The charity functioned by being inclusive and non-political, and by involving all the communities connected to the beach. They set up a Facebook page which attracted 1,200 supporters, ran social and fundraising events, and started a monthly newsletter. In 2018, the charity leased a strip of land leading to the beach, gained planning permission and started trying to fundraise \u00a335,000. In April 2019, new stairs were installed, through the fundraising efforts of the Friends of Castle Cove Beach Charity."}}

Clark Chapter house at 1101 W. Pennsylvania Ave. was just 7 years old).", "ATO along with Sigma Nu were all alone on the south side of campus\u2026 with the cows of course.", "What was pledging like?", "Did they call you Phrogues?", "I had attended Kemper Military School for my last two years of high school and first year of college so anything the ATO's threw at me was nothing to what I had experienced at Kemper.", "That was tough mostly because I hadn't yet figured out how to deal with it.", "By the time that I got to ATO, I was older and had learned that anything they did was not personal.", "It didn't bother me.", "One thing I do remember is that I wasn't a very good singer.", "They used to make me \"sing the phone book\" to a tune of their choosing.", "That was hard and brought a lot of laughs.", "I don't remember calling pledges Phrogues.", "In the Daily Illini at the time, they listed you along with 30 other pledges including Ken Seely, also from White Hall.", "However, your initiation group only listed 11 guys.", "Do you remember what happened to all of those guys?", "Yes, Ken followed me to ATO and was a good friend from home.", "I really don't remember why so few actually initiated.", "In an earlier interview, you mentioned that you struggled with school a little bit during your first year at Illinois.", "Was ATO the problem or part of the solution?", "Yes, Chemical Engineering at Illinois was very challenging.", "In fact, the head of the department tried to talk me into switching into something else after my first semester grades came out.", "I had found that the military school, as good as it was, was not good preparation compared to a freshman year at Illinois for Chemical Engineering.", "ATO was not the problem.", "In fact, the older guys who had previously taken my courses helped me out and everyone at ATO encouraged me to \"hang in there baby\".", "For me, failure was not an option.", "I stuck it out and got my grades in order the second semester.", "I read in a Daily Illini article that referred to you as \"Duck\" Giller.", "Was that your nickname in college?", "Yes, however that nickname actually followed me from high school.", "I had broken my ankle in a high school football game and it didn't get set properly.", "My foot was slightly askew\u2026 like a duck\u2026 hence the nickname.", "It's still like that today.", "I think Ken Seely probably brought that name for me to ATO from White Hall.", "I didn't like it too much so when I left Illinois, it didn't follow me into the rest of my life.", "You were mentioned several times in the Fraternity Gossip column \"The Campus Scout\" in the Daily Illini linked to a Kappa Delt, Vicky Reagan. \u2026", "Helping her with her studies, getting approval from her mother\u2026 pinning her\u2026 getting the pin back to give it to your brother for his initiation", "That was a creative way to break up.", "Do you remember anything about that?", "I do remember getting pinned but don't really remember Vicky.", "That was a long time ago.", "I remember that her father worked for Westinghouse.", "I don't remember asking for the pin back for my brother.", "I don't remember why we broke up.", "I think that we just faded apart after I graduated.", "It wasn't something terribly serious.", "Your brother, Jeff was also an ATO.", "His full name was actually Jefferson Davis Giller.", "That name caught my eye.", "Is there an old confederate story in your family history behind that name?", "Well the Gillers were at least three generations of farmers from south central Illinois but my mother's family, the Davis's.", "Were multi-generation southerners from Texas.", "Someone in the family once said that we were southerners who had the misfortune of growing up in Yankee country.", "I vaguely remember some story about an aunt from my mother's side who was a gun runner for the south in the Civil War.", "So, Jefferson Davis was a family name for my brother.", "Do you have any fun or particularly memorable stories from your time at ATO?", "Yes, I was a mischievous sort.", "In fact, that's why I was sent to military school in high school.", "Nothing serious\u2026 just mischief.", "Once in the dead of winter, in the middle of the night, one of my ATO brothers and I snuck into the Sigma Nu house and turned off their furnace.", "They woke up in the morning to bitter cold and no hot water.",

academics.", "As I said before, the head of the Chemical Engineering department tried to get me out.", "I stuck it out.", "That's an important lesson that I learned.", "\"Don't throw in the towel at the first bump.", "Don't give up too easy.\"", "Did you participate in intramurals?", "No, I was never into sports.", "As I mentioned, in high school, I tried football but broke my ankle.", "I tried

that time at ATO and at the University of Illinois?", "We had plenty of parties.", "Remember this was just a few years after the repeal of prohibition so everyone had to prove that they could drink beer.", "There was a lot of beer.", "I don't remember any whiskey.", "There was a beer hall in campus town called Bunny's that we frequented.", "Do you remember any of the guys?", "Who were the \"Characters\" in the house?", "I remember the Hemphill's of course\u2026 now they were very good athletes.", "I remember Ralph Ehni who played on the football team.", "Jack Moore, who you mentioned was someone who I liked and stayed in touch with for awhile.", "He was a strait shooting guy.", "Charlie Caudle was a real character.", "He was into music and had that \"entertainer\" personality.", "I never did run into him while he was leading the band in the USO shows for the military.", "I also remember Joe Giallombaro, the gymnast but I don't remember the story that you mentioned about him walking on his hands from the basement to the third floor of the ATO house.", "He may have done it and I may have witnessed it but I just don't remember.", "I have a few questions about your experiences in the military and your career after Illinois.", "I'm not going to repeat questions that you've answered in other published interviews but while I have you, I just want to take the opportunity to ask about some of these incredible things that you've been a part of and have witnessed.", "Ask away\u2026 it's your dime.", "There was an interesting story about how you came to acquire a 1939 BMW 328 in Germany shortly after the war.", "Do you still have that car?", "Yes, it's in the garage.", "It's for sale.", "Do you have $100,000?", "It's an antique.", "After the war in Germany, I met this captain.", "Germany had been very technologically advanced and this captain's job was to drive around Germany and to \"acquire\" technological advancements that he found and return them to the States.", "When I met him, he was driving this very nice BMW.", "He had painted it army green and put a number on it.", "That allowed him to get free gas whenever he wanted because now it was a \"Military\" vehicle.", "He told me a story about how he had acquired it.", "First, he found the car without the wheels in a German's old barn.", "The Germans at the time basically did whatever we asked so he decided to take it.", "He asked the family where the wheels were.", "Someone told him that their Grandmother had the wheels.", "He went to see the Grandmother and she wouldn't tell him where the wheels were until he mentioned something about sending her to Russia.", "She produced the wheels.", "He got it all put back together and running and that's when I met him.", "However, he soon found that he was being sent back home.", "I asked him what he was going to do with the car and he said that he didn't know.", "I offered him my Eisenhower jacket in exchange for the car and he took it.", "There's more to the story in other interviews but bottom line, I found a way to have it shipped back to the US and when I returned it was in my garage.", "It has followed me from Illinois to Washington and Albuquerque and back all of these years and I still have it.", "I understand you witnessed the detonation of several Atomic bombs.", "What was that like?", "I actually witnessed 10 detonations.", "My team's job was to study the after effects of the bombs.", "We would assess the viability of requests for different types of experiments and if they were approved, we would study what would happen.", "We weren't in charge of implementing the tests\u2026 just making measurements of the results.", "After a detonation, there would be a period where we needed to wear dark glasses but then we'd get the all clear signal and we could take them off.", "The light and boiling colors that were still visible were incredible.", "Then the shock wave would pass us like a giant\u2026 whoosh.", "It was something.", "(note that there are much more detailed descriptions of Ed's experiences with this testing that are a must read in some of the on-line interviews\u2026 particularly a story about testing of military uniforms which had to be done on pigs.", "I highly recommend reading these interviews).", "You were about the same age and era as many of the initial astronauts.",

front.", "I did fly some jets but that wasn't my preference.", "My interest in space was around what were the effects of setting off a nuclear bomb in space.", "I did quite a bit of work on that.", "I read that you were involved with the commission of the Condon Report with regard to studying the possibility of UFOs actually being extraterrestrials and whether they posed a threat.", "Was there anything in that research that caused you to think\u2026 maybe there is something out there?", "Yes, I was asked by my superiors to see if I could \"Lay this UFO business to rest\".", "I had the idea to hire and pay an independent agency, the National Academy to do the study.", "They said they would take our money as long as they were allowed to stay independent.", "The contractor that they hired to do the work was Condon.", "Bottom line, they studied the military and civilian sightings and determined that nearly 90% could be attributed to things like meteors, shooting stars and the reflection off known airplanes.", "We all agreed that there were some that could not be explained \u2013 UFOs.", "However we also agreed that none that were extraterrestrial threats.", "AND\u2026 I assure you

Russians?", "They had some very smart people.", "The head of their delegation at the time that I was involved spoke better English than the interpreters.", "As we were negotiating along with the British, one time he opened a meeting asking us if we wanted to use British or American English in the discussion.", "He could do either one.", "Our role was an in-between and we had to put forward a proposal and convince the other side to accept it.", "Then, they would tear it apart.", "We would do the same with theirs.", "The Russians had a way of putting a lot of positive emotion behind their proposals.", "It wasn't just logic or technology.", "It was emotion.", "They drank a lot of vodka too.", "Once the respective negotiations teams came to terms, we each had to go back and negotiate with our respective countries to get them to accept the negotiated proposals.", "That was often just as difficult.", "It was another world.", "You must have encountered some really interesting and strong leaders along the way.", "Who are some of the guys who stood out as particularly strong leaders?", "Albert \"Bud\" Wheelon was someone who I really admired.", "He was very sharp and a helluva good leader.", "He didn't just demand others to do things but he actually was able to inject himself into helping his teams find solutions to their problems.", "Bud Wheelon was the first Deputy

is altered in form.", "The most spectacular finding is an angel that holds the canopy over Mary's head, which is set down in the underdrawing.", "It was not produced in the final painting, however.", "A number of other, small amendments share the same goal of enhancing the spatial suggestion of the painting.", "The folds of the mantels of Mary and Luke cover a larger area in the first rendering.", "By drawing the draperies smaller, it appears as if there is more space between the two figures.", "Secondly, the structural fortifications on the left are adjusted so that the perspective becomes stronger.", "The crenellations of the fortifications and the wall of the inner courtyard, and the figures standing before it are all made smaller.", "Finally, the river is also painted wider than it is in the underdrawing.", "In opposition to the various changes in the Boston painting, the scientific research of the paintings in Bruges, St. Petersburg and Munich have 'exposed' none such changes.", "All three of the paintings closely follow the composition of the painted surface of the Boston painting.", "That means that the three anonymous painters copied from the completed painting that is in Boston.", "The artist of the painting in Munich even traced the painting from Boston and used that as the basis for his painting.", "It is possible that this is also the case with the Bruges painting, but this needs to be confirmed by research.", "### The Bruges Painting", "Despite the fact that the painting from the Groeninge Museum appears to be a copy, it still has a great art historical value.", "The painting is of high quality and has been kept in very good condition.", "An anonymous artist painted it between 1482 and 1500.", "Except for the three virtually identical copies of the Boston painting, there are still many other works known to be inspired by this painting.", "What is striking is that nearly all of these works are dated at the end of the 15th Century.",

Erwin Panofsky suggested c. 1434 as the earliest possible date, and that the Rolin panel was completed in 1433 or 1434. Julius Held was sceptical of this early dating, noting that if true we are \"forced to assume that within one year of Jan's work Rogier received a commission which gave him an opportunity to adopt Jan's compositional pattern while subjecting it at the same time to a very thorough and highly personal transformation, and all this in Bruges, under Jan's very eyes\". \n Held, as a lone voice and writing in 1955, argues for a date between 1440 and 1443, seeing the work as more advanced than other paintings by the artist from the mid-1430s, and believes it contains \"considerable differences\" when compared to other early works, especially the \"Annunciation Triptych\" of c. 1434. He further observes that although the painting became highly influential, copies did not appear until the mid-century. \n Dendrochronological examination of the growth rings in the panel's wood suggests that the timber was felled around 1410. In the 15th century, wood was typically stored for around 20 years before use in panel painting, giving an earliest date in the mid to late 1430s. Analysis of the Munich version places it in the 1480s, around 20 years after van der Weyden's death."}}

map coordinates.", "All very JJ Abrams, I say to Howard.", "Except he has no clue what I'm talking about; someone in his management team was responsible.", "Whether he planned it or not, Russell Howard is the best British example of a comedian whose career would be very different without the internet.", "In the US there's Rob Delaney, a stand-up whose 'funniest man on Twitter' moniker lead to his own TV show.", "Or Marc Maron, a respected comic whose nosediving career was transformed when he began a podcast of soul-searching (ie, not very funny) interviews with other comedians; he now has a TV sitcom, an autobiography on the way and stars queuing up to talk to him.", "But the movement's hangdog, middle-aged poster boy is Louis CK, a brilliant stand-up who turned out to be an equally brilliant businessman; he's driven down his ticket prices by cutting out middlemen and selling through his own website, and in 2011 made over $1.1 million by offering downloads of a comedy special for just $5.", "None of these men is a household name, yet they can sell out tours with a few keystrokes (CK, who barely has a profile at all in the UK, filled the O2 Arena in minutes last month).",

first place?'", "It's inconceivable...\"", "Howard's sensitivity is both a blessing and a curse.", "His heart-on-sleeve anti-cynicism is a huge part of his appeal and the reason fans, even male ones, are constantly trying to hug him.", "Each show of his last tour ended with a list of things that bring him joy \u2013 'stationary', 'watching a goth laugh', 'the noise old women make when someone puts food in front of them' \u2013 and his favourite part of 'Good News' is the closing 'good news story', an unashamedly heart-warming clip of triumph over tragedy that sometimes causes Howard's eyes to moisten on camera.", "He admits that a lot of people around him were against that segment because \"it didn't belong on a comedy programme\".", "But giving the show a touch of \"warmness\" was important to him.", "\"It's a really nice way to send people to bed \u2013 something sweet,\" he says.", "Social media maven?", "'When you first appear on TV you go through the self-googling phase,'

stand-up Stewart Lee devoted a routine to Howard's part in a charity bike ride, which raised \u00a31 million for Sport Relief.", "If Howard rode his bike every day, Lee argued, he would raise \u00a313,357,014.30p for starving African children.", "\"And yet he chooses not to do that,\" Lee went on.", "\"He chooses instead to make \u00a34 million for himself...", "Russell Howard's as good as

work out why I'd been selected.", "He was trying to make out that all I was interested was making money for myself.", "I do get what he was trying to do, but when it's about you it's very difficult to be rational.", "I felt like I was being bullied by the cool kid at school.", "Because Stu's so revered, it was exactly like being in the sixth-form common room and the smartest and most popular kid is sneering at you.\"", "Anyway, Howard insists that the \u00a34 million isn't true.", "Does he know how much he IS worth?", "'I don't know.", "And I don't want to know!", "I'm doing absolutely fine.",

he lives with his doctor girlfriend, Cerys, and their Jack Russell, Archie.", "His parents, Ninette and Dave, live nearby in Bath; has he paid off their mortgage?", "\"No, I haven't.\"", "Because they don't want him to?", "\"Actually, I think they'd be delighted.", "I'm pretty sure my mum wants me to buy her a hot tub.\"", "While his relationship with Cerys is off-limits in Howard's stand-up act (\"she's got a proper job, she doesn't need me spoiling her life\"), his family is a bottomless well of material.", "\"They're just so big and wild,\" he says of his 40 cousins, three of whom once

was gonna do something terrible...'", "They were in tears.\"", "Howard's life is comically un-starry, and in 'Wonderbox' he plans to talk about those inevitable awkward moments when two worlds collide: taking his mother to the opening of 'I Give It A Year' (his first film premiere, and he only attended because his actress sister Kerry has a role), or being recognised just as Archie decides to defecate in the street.", "His best friends are still stand-ups he began his career with, Daniel Kitson and John Oliver among them.", "As a group they were once known as the 'Chocolate Milk Gang'

other Grandmasters, but that's not the only purpose of the PRO Chess League.", "We want to bring high level chess competition to places that may not have the high density of Grandmasters that are available in other cities.", "We love that we have teams that will be full of GM's each week, and also teams that are filled with more local stars.", "Maybe those teams won't be able to win it all,

would've been a low first- or high second-round pick otherwise.", "But there were whispers at the time, too, that Hernandez was caught up in more serious things.", "The word \"gang\" was bandied about in conversation.", "Since team officials I talked to at the time said it never really went past the rumor stage, we decided, in print, to stay away from it.", "What was obvious was this was a guy, with drugs and otherwise, who had a way of getting himself into and then out of trouble.", "So with the Patriots mum when it came to what they knew about Hernandez, either in 2010 or '13, and as I worked through my takeout piece on how college prospects are vetted by teams, an obvious question arose.", "And it's the same one I sought to answer early that May:", "What, exactly, did clubs know?",

there's an issue, he's around it.'", "If there was trouble, Hernandez's name would come up.", "...", "He was a con guy.", "Very believable.", "Spoke well.", "A lot of things inside of you hoped you'd turn him around, but people that I talked to said they didn't trust him, that he'd burn you.\"", "Those who were at Florida, working under Urban Meyer, confirm that much: Hernandez had a way of beating the system.", "Said one ex-Gator staffer, \"He was really intelligent, and that's why he was such a pain in the ass.", "He knew how to beat the system on everything.\"", "Hernandez has been in jail since June 26.", "He is facing a first-degree murder charge, as well as five gun charges, and also is being investigated in connection to a July 2012 double homicide in Boston.", "So yes, the system would seem to have caught up with him.", "And by now, NFL teams have looked at how Hernandez got from Point A to Point B as they attempt to refine how they review and reject prospects based on off-field problems.", "It's a challenge, to be sure.", "Hernandez won a national championship and earned All-America honors at Florida.", "(Phil Sandlin/Associated Press)", "Meyer and his coaches privately told some clubs that, to be managed, it was crucial that Hernandez be surrounded by the right people.", "At Florida, the staff did its best to dissuade him from going home over breaks in the school calendar because of the element waiting in Connecticut, and even got nervous on game weekends, when that crowd typically would migrate south to Gainesville and roll with Hernandez.", "The Gator coaches aligned Hernandez with Mike and Maurkice Pouncey, whom Hernandez roomed with off campus.", "The three grew close, and the staff generally considered the Pounceys a positive influence.", "(Since then, Mike has been named in Ted Wells' report as one of the players who contributed to the harassment of Dolphins teammate Jonathan Martin.)", "Meyer also had Tim Tebow rooming with Hernandez for road games, in the hopes that being around the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner would show the standout tight end the right way to do things.", "\"The year before he came out, I was at their pro day, and I remember seeing the Pounceys, and then him,\" said a second AFC college director, whose club had Hernandez on the board, but not draftable where he went (No. 113 overall, in the fourth round).", "\"It was very clear that (the Pounceys) were the leaders, that they were the influential guys, and he was behind them, a tagalong, a follower in that sense.", "He was always following them.", "And they were trying to bring him along.\"", "An NFC personnel executive added, \"He was very, very immature.", "Urban did him right by having him follow Tebow -- and he was such a follower.", "He could go in any direction.", "And everyone knew that if you didn't keep an eye on him, he was an easy guy to persuade to do the wrong thing.\"", "The failed drug tests (Florida contends it was only one failed test) were, of course, central to the problem -- and it wasn't really the pot.", "At the college level, players are put in position to pass drug tests; thus, pro clubs look at multiple positives as a sign that an athlete either a) doesn't care or b) has a problem.", "So Hernandez's ability to stay in line was automatically in question.", "Just the same, and even with details remaining shadowy, questions lingered about that crowd around Hernandez and how its presence played into his mental health.", "The background several clubs gathered had Hernandez gravitating toward an unsavory element within his family after his father's death in 2006, which would wind up forming the baseline of the group that the Florida coaches, and later NFL teams, were so concerned about.", "The tough part was, in football settings, he was mostly OK, showing only flashes of instability.", "\"He was considered a cool guy to be around,\" said an NFC personnel director whose club had Hernandez off the board.", "\"But around the program, he was the one guy everyone knew not to mess with.", "They knew he'd fight.", "He had a temper.", "I don't think anyone would've predicted what's going on now.", "He was one of those where it was hard to determine whether to take him off the board.", "You didn't say, 'He's a murderer.'", "My feeling is, most people had him off their boards because of the (drug) tests.\"", "And that's where some of the divide was: The question of whether someone who made you want to believe he was a good guy was actually a bad guy, or simply a college kid needing to grow up.", "The second AFC college director said that one pre-draft meeting his club had with Hernandez got \"emotional,\" with the prospective pick trying to convince the club that he wasn't the con man some portrayed him to be.", "In the process, he did more damage to his stock, making the officials in the room question if he was worth the trouble.", "\"He admitted to smoking, and basically that was the environment he was brought up in, how comfortable he was with smoking,\" said the personnel man.", "\"It was the emotional state of this kid, the highs and lows, the overall stability that got you.", "You're not saying, 'OK, this guy may be a murderer.'", "It was just, 'He's not mentally ready.' \"", "In the same vein, the college director said what worried his club was what would happen once Hernandez left the Gainesville cocoon: \"Urban's getting beat up, but Urban does have rules.", "I know the coaches.", "They stayed on him.", "Mickey Marotti and Charlie Strong and Greg Mattison, they were anchors.", "They weren't letting him get away.\"", "As for the questions about gang affiliation, the rumors, again, were there.", "But according to these evaluators, that is hardly uncommon.", "Plenty of players who grow up in gang-ridden areas enter the draft every year, and it certainly can be challenging for scouts to separate a player who is tangentially connected from those who are truly involved.", "In that sense, geography wound up contributing to the Patriots' issue.", "That year, prevailing opinion was that Dallas was the one place that Texas native Dez Bryant, also known for being impressionable and having questionable hangers-on, couldn't be drafted to.", "He, of course, landed there.", "The Cowboys have been proactive in monitoring and policing him, and it's worked out so far.", "Similarly, the Patriots provided Hernandez, through proximity, access to his past in Bristol, Conn.", "And obviously, that one went the other way.", "\"Geographically, the kid couldn't be closer to his hometown and his roots and his background,\" said an AFC personnel executive.", "\"He couldn't have come to an NFL team closer to home.", "I

A legal showdown with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS) followed, \"1987\" was forcibly withdrawn from sale, and The JAMs were ordered to \"deliver up the master tape, mothers, stampers and any other parts commensurate with manufacture of the record\". \n King Boy D and Rockman Rock travelled to ABBA's home country of Sweden, in the hope of meeting with ABBA personally, taking an \"NME\" journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP and a gold disc of the album. Failing to find ABBA in residence at Polar Studios in Stockholm, they instead presented the gold disc to a blonde prostitute they pretended was Agnetha \"fallen on hard times.\" Of the original LP's stock, some copies were disposed overboard on the North Sea ferry trip across, and the remainder were burned in a field in Gothenburg before dawn (as shown on the cover of their next album, \"Who Killed The JAMs?\"). The JAMs also played a recording of \"The Queen and I\" loudly outside the offices of ABBA's record label, Polar Music. The trip was unexpectedly eventful, the JAMs accidentally hitting and killing a moose, and later being shot at by a farmer, a bullet cracking the engine of their Ford Galaxie police car."}}

on Human Rights in Cambodia, made it clear in his October 1997 report to the UN General Assembly: the events of July 5-6 were a \"coup d'\u00e9tat.\"", "This seemed plain to those of us living through those tumultuous times in Cambodia, and has been confirmed by subsequent research.", "Through interviews at the time and in the years since with senior CPP and FUNCINPEC officials, senior military officials of the CPP, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF, diplomats, foreign military attaches, human rights workers, and residents of Phnom Penh who witnessed the fighting, the basic facts are clear.", "The evidence shows that this was not a CPP coup, but a coup by Hun Sen.", "Other senior CPP figures, including party president Chea Sim, Interior Minister Sar Kheng, Defense Minister Tea Banh, and head of the armed forces Ke Kim Yan, argued against military action and refused to mobilize their forces, causing deep strains in the party.", "After the coup, many senior CPP officials who refused to participate sandbagged their homes and put their guards on full alert, fearful that Hun Sen would then strike against them for their disloyalty.", "Even without the support of much of his party, Hun Sen was able to put together enough military power to succeed.", "On July 5-6 his ad hoc forces, led by loyalists including Kun Kim, Mol Roeup, Sao Sokha, Hok Lundy, and Keo Pong, defeated the FUNCINPEC forces who had not been disarmed in the previous week.", "He then unleashed his forces to carry out a campaign of extrajudicial executions, primarily of FUNCINPEC military officers.", "I and many of my colleagues at the UN human rights office had the unforgettable experience of digging up the bodies of men stripped naked to their underwear, handcuffed behind their backs, blindfolded, and shot in the head.", "Executions and torture", "In many cases it was clear who carried out these killings.", "One unit in particular, the \"911\" parachute regiment under Colonel Chap Pheakadey, was clearly responsible for a series of executions and torture.", "The government has never opened an investigation or made efforts to prosecute Pheakedey or any other perpetrators.", "Instead of being prosecuted, Pheakadey is now a General.", "Donors and diplomats who say they are committed to the fight against impunity have simply dropped the issue.", "What caused the coup?", "Many trace it back to the flawed power sharing formula after FUNCINPEC won the UNTAC-organized elections in May 1993.", "The CPP insisted on an equal share of power and refused to relinquish control of the security services.", "The international community and then Prince Norodom Sihanouk imposed a coalition with Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen as co-Prime Ministers.", "The CPP's successful threat to use force if its conditions were not met may have emboldened Hun Sen to use military force if his hold on power was ever threatened again.", "One could also point to the failed coup attempt of July 2, 1994 against Hun Sen and Ranariddh - by members of Hun Sen's own party.", "This coup attempt was led by former Minister of Interior Sin Song and national police chief Sin Sen, both of whom were furious at Hun Sen for being left out of the coalition government.", "The coup attempt was backed by Thaksin Shinawatra's IBC TV, after his television contract was ripped up by the co-Prime Ministers.", "Ironically, Hun Sen was saved in part by Ranariddh and FUNINCPEC forces under General Nhek Bun Chhay, who sent their forces to confront rebel CPP tanks motoring in from their stronghold in Prey Veng.", "A party divided", "Hun Sen learned a huge lesson that day: he could not trust his party to protect his personal security.", "The price Hun Sen exacted from the CPP coup plotters and their patrons was greater control of the armed forces.", "He appointed his own man, Hok Lundy, as national police chief.", "Until then internal security had been Chea Sim's domain.", "Hok Lundy reported directly to Hun Sen despite the fact that his formal boss was Sar Kheng - a close confidante of Chea Sim and an internal party opponent of Hun Sen.", "Perhaps even more important, Hun Sen decided to build up his personal \"bodyguard unit\" into a de facto private army.", "All of this soon made Hun Sen the strongest physical force in the CPP.", "Hok Lundy and the bodyguard unit played key roles in the July 1997 coup.", "One could also point to Ranariddh's decision in early 1996 to confront the CPP.", "The CPP had reneged on a promise to appoint FUNCINPEC members to half the district chief positions in the country, a key part of the 1993 coalition agreement.", "There was deep dissatisfaction in FUNCINPEC over the lack of real power sharing (and the opportunities for corruption that came with it) and the party's clearly second-class status in the government.", "Ranariddh had shown himself to be a weak and incompetent leader.", "His party was losing public esteem as it failed to implement any of its 1993 campaign promises on corruption, human rights or land.", "Ranariddh decided that FUNCINPEC should attempt to reach military parity with the CPP.", "It was a ridiculous idea to compete with Hun Sen and the CPP in military terms, \"laughable,\" as many foreign military attach\u00e9s later told me.", "Long before July 1997, Hun Sen had tried but failed to convince his party to authorize military action against FUNCINPEC.", "His intentions were discerned as early as April 1996 by the UN political representative in Cambodia, Benny Widyono.", "Widyono warned in a cable to UN headquarters that Hun Sen was contemplating getting rid of Ranariddh.", "After meeting Hun Sen, Widyono concluded that Hun Sen was mapping out his \"usual strategy: to patiently probe Prince Ranariddh's weaknesses and, when the time comes, to strike at those weaknesses, swiftly and aggressively.\"", "Widyono believed that Hun Sen was angling to arrest Ranariddh.", "Two days later, reacting to a threat by FUNCINPEC to dissolve the National Assembly and call early elections, Hun Sen warned that he might use military force, declaring, \"I have the forces to do it.\"", "According to another cable from Widyono, Hun Sen wanted to arrest FUNCINPEC generals, but was blocked by the opposition of CPP armed forces chief Ke Kim Yan.", "A further report from Widyono's office stated that at a secret April 30, 1996 meeting of CPP leaders, Hun Sen proposed taking military action against the FUNCINPEC \"machinery.\"", "This was reportedly opposed by most CPP leaders, including Ke Kim Yan, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng.", "General Pol Sarouen, Kandal deputy governor Kun Kim and Phnom Penh deputy governor Chea Sophara were reported to support Hun Sen.", "In June 1996 Chea Sim felt it necessary to publicly air his concerns, stating that there should be no confrontation between CPP and FUNCINPEC.", "By the beginning of 1997, the coalition government was falling apart.", "About the only thing the two parties had in common was a rapacious appetite for wealth gained through high-level corruption.", "Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, head of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), now agreed to work together to defeat the CPP in the 1998 elections.", "Political factions", "In February 1997 fighting broke out between FUNCINPEC and CPP forces in Battambang province.", "An \"Abnormal Conflict Resolution Committee\" was established to prevent a recurrence.", "It was chaired by co-Ministers of Interior Sar Kheng and You Hokry (FUNCINPEC) and included Ke Kim Yan and Nhek Bun Chhay.", "None of these people had the power to block Hun Sen when he decided to use military force.", "At the same time, CPP officials say that Hun Sen was deeply concerned that the more moderate Sar Kheng was being promoted through the \"Abnormal Committee\" as his successor by some in the CPP, FUNCINPEC and some diplomats.", "By this time Hun Sen's popularity was rapidly declining in the country and within his own party.", "There were frequent press reports about deep splits in the CPP between the Hun Sen and Chea Sim-Sar Kheng factions, with many in the party wanting to replace Hun Sen with someone they considered more palatable to voters.", "Fearing the newly announced alliance between FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy's KNP, Hun Sen wanted to arrest Rainsy, who was busily building his new party.", "Minister of Justice Chem Snguon confirmed this to me, saying that Hun Sen had asked him to arrest Rainsy.", "According to Snguon, no fan of Rainsy, \"I told him, 'How could I?", "I didn't have any grounds.'\"", "The March 30, 1997 grenade attack on a KNP rally led by Rainsy, which killed 16 and injured more than 150, soon followed.", "Hun Sen reacted by ordering Rainsy's arrest.", "The demand was so outrageous - Rainsy was nearly killed in the attack - that the order was ignored.", "In early April Hun Sen engineered a split within FUNCINPEC in an attempt to gain sufficient votes in the National Assembly to remove Ranariddh as Prime Minister.", "This was not difficult, as many FUNCINPEC MPs were deeply disaffected from Ranariddh.", "At one point Hun Sen claimed 22 FUNCINPEC \"neutrals\" would vote against Ranariddh.", "But after leaving Hun Sen's home at Tuol Kraisang many of the MPs recanted, some going into hiding.", "The attempt to remove Ranariddh through \"legal\" means failed.", "Coup rumors swirled.", "On April 28, 1997, Hun Sen announced that he had nothing to gain from a coup as he already held full power legitimately, but warned, \"If I decide to hold a coup d'etat, it can hardly be prevented.\"", "He was right.", "Fallout factors", "The FBI was sent to investigate the March 30 grenade attack because an American, Ron Abney, was injured and it was classified as a terrorist attack by the State Department.", "By May 15, the investigation had implicated Hun Sen's bodyguard unit, not least because it allowed the grenade throwers through its lines to escape before turning its guns to stop those giving chase.", "Investigations showed that Hok Lundy's police, who normally were deployed at demonstrations, were ordered to stand down that morning.", "The lead FBI agent told the Cambodian police that things looked \"very bad\" for Hun Sen, especially since \"Hun Sen's people didn't tell the truth.\"", "This was reported back to Hun Sen.", "On May 25, a large shipment of arms signed for by Ranariddh for his bodyguard unit arrived at Kampong Som port.", "The CPP-controlled military court opened a case against Ranariddh.", "Hun Sen accused Ranariddh of trying to import weapons illegally and destabilizing the government.", "It is unclear if this shipment was legal, but what is certain is that the CPP, like FUNCINPEC, was regularly importing arms and weapons without informing the other side.", "\"This was routine and both sides knew about it,\" a senior CPP official told me, a point confirmed by many other CPP and FUNCINPEC officials and military attach\u00e9s from France, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.", "During this time both FUNCINPEC and the CPP began to move forces into and around Phnom Penh in anticipation of armed conflict.", "Both were also attempting to strike a deal with remaining Khmer Rouge forces in the north of the country (Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge forces in western Pailin and Malai areas had defected to Hun Sen, who outbid Ranariddh, in August 1996).", "Hun Sen accused FUNCINPEC of bringing Khmer Rouge soldiers from Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng into Phnom Penh, giving massive air time to a former Khmer Rouge fighter named Phon Pheap, who alleged Nhek Bun Chhay was hiding large numbers of Khmer Rouge at the FUNCINPEC base near the airport at Tang Kraisang.", "Ranariddh fed these claims by engaging in ham-fisted and desperate negotiations with Khieu Samphan to defect and bring his forces, Ieng Sary-style, to the FUNCINPEC side.", "I was part of a team of UN staff who interviewed alleged Khmer Rouge soldiers captured after the coup.", "We found only a few who may have been Khmer Rouge, but most were farmers from Prey Veng or Svay Rieng who had been offered money to come to Phnom Penh for work.", "This is not to say there were none.", "In May 1997 I saw two Khmer Rouge soldiers guarding a safe house for FUNCINPEC \"neutral\" MPs in Phnom Penh.", "They had the look of jungle fighters and said they were from Malai.", "There were other anecdotal reports of Khmer Rouge forces coming to join FUNCINPEC.", "However, no credible evidence of the presence of significant numbers of Khmer Rouge members from Anlong Veng has ever been produced.", "French, Australian and Singaporean military attaches told me the claims were unfounded.", "On the other hand, as many as 300 former Khmer Rouge fighters fought in the coup on Hun Sen's side under the command of Khmer Rouge defector Keo Pong.", "Blood feud", "In mid-June, forces under the command of Hok Lundy and FUNCINPEC deputy Minister of Interior Ho Sok fought along Norodom Boulevard in Phnom Penh.", "Two FUNCINPEC troops were killed.", "The tension in Phnom Penh was intense, with many expecting armed conflict to break out at any time.", "However, many others believed that Hun Sen would be blocked by others in his own party.", "These optimists, including many diplomats and some in FUNCINPEC, were wrong.", "In late June, Hun Sen again attempted to convince CPP leaders to back his plans to take power by force.", "Those present at the meeting say that this was strongly opposed by Ke Kim Yan, Tea Banh, Chea Sim and Sar Kheng.", "They argued that FUNCINPEC was not a military threat and that while it might have been bringing some Khmer Rouge into Phnom Penh, the number was not significant.", "They argued that the country had made too much progress since the Paris Peace Agreements to put it all at risk, and that they would be blamed by the international community and Cambodians if they used force to solve political problems.", "On June 29 Hun Sen announced that he would no longer cooperate with Ranariddh.", "He demanded that members of the Khmer Rouge in Phnom Penh surrender to his forces or face tough action.", "On the same day, CPP General Pol Sareoun told a foreign historian that unless Ranariddh was arrested, there was soon going to be a \"little war\" with FUNCINPEC.", "That same day, the Washington Post quoted an FBI report alleging that Hun Sen's bodyguards were involved in the March 30 grenade attack.", "Credible reports began to come in that CPP tanks were being positioned around Phnom Penh, while FUNCINPEC consolidated its forces in Taing Kraisang.", "One western military attach\u00e9 with close contacts in the CPP told me that he briefed his embassy on how the tanks would be deployed into Phnom Penh, how they would take FUNCINPEC military installations, and how they would secure radio and TV stations.", "Ranariddh flees", "On July 1, the military court asked the National Assembly to lift Ranariddh's parliamentary immunity so it could charge him with illegal weapons smuggling.", "On July 2, CPP forces seized FUNCINPEC's Prek Ta Ten base along route 5 north of Phnom Penh, killing one FUNCINPEC soldier and wounding three.", "On July 3, Ranariddh returned to Phnom Penh from Kampong Cham by helicopter after he was told that an operation was afoot to arrest him en route.", "His bodyguards drove to Phnom Penh.", "Along the way, pro-Hun Sen troops stopped them and gave them the choice of being shot or disarmed.", "According to an American official, the CPP forces involved said they hoped to provoke a fight and were unhappy that Ranariddh's bodyguards did not take the bait.", "Ranariddh fled to France the next day, July 4, after being warned by his security officials that Hun Sen would try to arrest or kill him.", "Negotiations throughout that night between Nhek Bun Chhay and CPP military leaders, including Ke Kim Yan and Tea Banh, proved fruitless.", "FUNCINPEC military figures wanted assurances that if they grouped in Taing Kraisang they would continue to be recognized as members of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and would not be harmed.", "Hun Sen demanded that they disarm, but Nhek Bun Chhay refused, fearing that he and his forces would be killed - which is what happened to many after the coup.", "By the morning of July 5, Hun Sen's forces were ready to strike at Taing Kraisang, a small FUNCINPEC base next to the airport, the homes of officers like Nhek Bun Chhay and Chau Sambath, FUNCINPEC party headquarters, and Ranariddh's home in central Phnom Penh.", "By the end of the next day, FUNCINPEC's forces were routed.", "The 1997 coup has been by far the most important event in Cambodia since the 1993 UNTAC elections.", "It shattered all illusions that the country was on the path to democracy.", "It showed that violence was still an acceptable political choice for the country's leaders.", "It showed indifference to the lingering trauma and fear that so many Cambodians retained after the Khmer Rouge period and the bloody 1993 UNTAC elections.", "It made clear that commitments to human rights were just words on paper.", "The widespread and planned post-coup extrajudicial executions of FUNCINPEC military figures carried out by Hun Sen's forces took place under the international community's noses and underlined continuing impunity for the most serious human rights violations.", "Even the most blatant abuses, such as the murder of Ho Sok in the custody of the forces of Hok Lundy in an interior ministry office, have gone uninvestigated and unpunished.", "More than anything, the coup and Hun Sen's successful navigation of the ensuing domestic and international political fallout, culminating in the CPP's defeat of the political opposition in 1998's fundamentally flawed election and Hun Sen's subsequent success in seeing off the Chea Sim-Sar Kheng faction in his own party, set the country on the course to Hun Sen's almost total dominion over political and military power in Cambodia.", "No one now believes (as a few did at the time), for example, that if an opposition party obtained more votes than the CPP that Hun Sen would relinquish power.", "The coup, therefore, stole something intangible yet essential: it stole hope from people who had just begun to dare to dream that their future would be decided by the ballot instead of the bullet.", "Brad Adams is Asia director at Human Rights Watch.", "#### Region / Country",

attacks against Hun Sen, accusing him of harbouring plans to restore a Communist regime should the CPP win the next general election. At the same time Ranariddh attempted to persuade moderate leaders of the Khmer Rouge, including Khieu Samphan and Tep Kunnal, to join the NUF. Khieu Samphan accepted Ranariddh's overtures, and on 21 May 1997, he announced that his party, the Khmer National Solidarity Party (KNSP) would support the NUF. Ranariddh welcomed Samphan's announcement, and on 4 June 1997, both leaders signed a communiqu\u00e9 pledging mutual support. Five days later, customs officials at Sihanoukville discovered a three-ton shipment of rocket launchers, assault rifles and handguns, labelled \"spare parts\" and consigned to Ranariddh. The rocket launchers were seized by Cambodian Air Force officers aligned to the CPP, while Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) officials aligned to FUNCINPEC were allowed to keep the light weapons.

Wrigley Field.", "The final selection process began on the first day.", "League officials systematically scrutinized each player.", "They were tested on playing their field position, throwing, catching, running, sliding and hitting.", "At the end of the day, no one wanted to answer the phone for fear of being told they would have to pack and go home.", "Those who survived the cut were signed to professional league contracts which stated they were not to have any other employment during the baseball season.", "Salaries were high for many of these young players, some as young as 15.", "In many cases they were making more than their parents who had skilled occupations.", "Salaries ranged from $45 to $85 a week plus.", "Those who were signed not only had to be highly skilled players, they also had to comply with high moral standards and rules of conduct imposed by the League.", "In addition, femininity was a high priority.", "Wrigley contracted with Helena Rubenstein's Beauty Salon to meet with the players at spring training.", "After their daily practices, the women were required to attend Rubenstein's evening charm school classes.", "The proper etiquette for every situation was taught, and every aspect of personal hygiene, mannerisms and dress code was presented to all the players.", "In an effort to make each player as physically attractive as possible, each player received a beauty kit and instructions on how to use it.", "(See Charm School and Rules of Conduct for details).", "Mrs. Wrigley, Wrigley's Art Designer, Otis Shepard, and Ann Harnett collaborated to design special uniforms for the League.", "Ann Harnett, Chicago softball star and the first girl to sign a contract with the league, became a model for the new uniforms.", "The one-piece short-skirted flared tunic was fashioned after the figure skating, field hockey, and tennis costumes of the period.", "Satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks and baseball hat completed the uniform.", "Each city had a different colored uniform and its own symbolic patch decorated the front of the uniform.", "## League Play - 1943", "The League Office assigned managers, players and chaperones to teams.", "It was their intent to balance the talent on each city's team to make league play highly competitive.", "Players were often traded in mid-season to maintain that balance.", "League play officially began on May 30, 1943 with South Bend playing in Rockford and Kenosha playing in Racine.", "A total of 108 games were played in the regular season, which ran from mid-May to the first of September.", "The team to win the most games during the regular season was declared the pennant winner.", "The top teams then competed in a series of play-off games to determine the League Champion.", "At the end of the 1943 season, the Kenosha Comets played a 5-game series against the Racine Belles for the Championship.", "Racine won and became the first World Champions of the All-American Girls Baseball League.", "Players Lined up in Their Wartime, Pre-Game \"V\" for Victory Formation.", "(Northern Indiana Center for History Collection)", "Assessment of the first year of play was encouraging.", "The teams were well received by fans in the four sponsoring cities.", "Attendance was tracked at 176,612 fans for the 1943 season.", "National League officials, the press and baseball fans across the country were amazed at how well the women played ball and by the enthusiasm and support the teams received in their host cities.", "Several factors contributed to this success.", "Most of the nation was involved in one way or another in the war effort.", "Women, who were formerly homemakers, left their homes to support the war by taking jobs in factories that were converted into making munitions and other military machinery.", "This change in the traditional occupation of women made the environment much friendlier for accepting women as professional ball players.", "Another factor was the limits the war placed on the American people.", "Some foods, luxury items, tires and gasoline were rationed.", "People were forced to spend their leisure time close to home.", "Going to the ballpark was a popular form of entertainment.", "Wrigley also managed to capitalize on the patriotic mood of the country.", "America's young men were off fighting for our country, dreaming of t he girls they left behind.", "Playing on the Theme of \"All-American Girl,\" he promoted the image that the players were symbols of \"the girl next door\" in spikes.", "At the beginning of each game, the two teams formed a \"V\" for Victory from home plate down the first and third baselines followed by the playing of the Star Spangled Banner.", "The players played an even greater part in displaying patriotism by playing exhibition games to support the Red Cross and the armed forces, as well as visiting wounded veterans at Army Hospitals.", "Talent for the league was abundant, and it was soon evident that the women's high caliber of play was going to be the main drawing card for the fans.", "## League Expansion", "May 14 to May 25, 1944, was the time set for the second spring training camp for the AAGPBL.", "It was held in Peru, Illinois, and one hundred twenty girls, six managers and all league personnel were housed either at the Peru Hotel or at the St. Francis Hotel in Peru's twin city, LaSalle.", "There was access to three diamonds for the camp, swimming pools and a gym.", "Ruth Tiffany School was contracted to run the nightly charm school.", "The emphasis was to make \"bright stars\" of each player by integrating a healthy mind and a healthy body.", "The arts of walking, sitting, speaking, selecting clothes, applying make-up, and social skills were again part of the program.", "The importance of being feminine and projecting the image of \"The All-American Girl Next Door,\" along with outstanding athletic ability, continued to be on the top of Wrigley's list of priorities.", "As a result of the success of the League in its first year, civic groups in each of the four cities agreed to finance their own franchises.", "This gave Wrigley the opportunity to try his dream of placing the girls' teams in Major League parks.", "He, Paul Harper, and Branch Rickey agreed to finance two additional teams to play in American Association ball parks in Minneapolis and Milwaukee.", "League scheduling for the 1944 season was structured to play in the minor league stadiums of these two cities during the time periods the men were on road trips.", "Former Major League Hall of Famer, Max Carey, became the manager for the newly formed Milwaukee Chicks, and Bubber Jonnard, was chosen to manage the Minneapolis Millerettes.", "## League Play - 1944", "The two new teams were excited to be playing in American Association League parks.", "However, when compared to teams playing in smaller parks in the medium-sized cities of Racine, Kenosha, Rockford, and South Bend, the differences were obvious.", "Media coverage was a big difference.", "The smaller cities received extensive media support.", "Like the men's teams, all the games were reported with articles and box scores and sometimes the papers even ran photographs.", "In the large cities, the games were often not even mentioned or received negative publicity.", "The fans sat very close to the field and the dugouts and became friendly with the players as individuals in the smaller cities.", "In the large stadiums, the distances between the fans and the player did not give the women this advantage.", "Even the size of the field itself was a handicap to the women who could not hit the ball over the fences for homeruns.", "This sharp contrast between the men playing faster regulation baseball on certain nights, and the women basically playing a modified softball fast pitch on others, did not favor the women.", "Even though the larger cities offered a greater population base, there was also a much greater diversity of entertainment opportunities from which people could choose to spend their leisure time.", "Attempts to add pre-game entertainment of all kinds, including novel symphony performances, failed to increase attendance.", "Another factor in the failure of the Minneapolis and Milwaukee teams may have been Wrigley's decision to \"go it alone\" in these cities or his inability to recruit local guarantors to subsidize teams there.", "In any case, he didn't have the nucleus of leading businessmen in Minneapolis and Milwaukee to support and promote their AAGPBL teams as had been accomplished in the smaller cities.", "Early in the 1944 season, it became evident that the war would not force major league baseball to disband, and Wrigley lost interest in the girls' league.", "Despite poor attendance in the two American Association parks, overall AAGPBL attendance increased.", "After the season, Wrigley sold the League to his Chicago advertising executive, Arthur Meyerhoff.", "It was under Meyerhoff that expansion and publicity of the League reached its peak.", "On Nov. 15, 1944, Meyerhoff met with representatives from the four original cities and re-organized the League so that each franchise would be governed through a League Board of Directors with representatives from each franchise.", "Each club now had a voice in the adoption of rules and regulations and the direction of the sport.", "All assets were turned over to the new directors and Wrigley was no longer involved with the league.", "Ken Sells resigned as league president and Max Carey was named the new president.", "## League Play - 1945", "Meyerhoff undertook a rigorous advertising campaign to promote the League in 1945.", "Everything was going well with the war and for the League.", "Patriotic fans were ensuring the League had a future.", "Families were turning out in large numbers at all the ballparks.", "The Milwaukee Chicks were picked up by Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the Minneapolis Millerettes went to Fort Wayne, Indiana.", "Meyerhoff continued to project the image he and Wrigley had envisioned for these women.", "They were now involved deeply in displaying their abilities on the playing field.", "The emphasis changed and Charm School was discontinued.", "Meyerhoff arranged for the girls to play exhibition games at 13 army camps and veteran hospitals during the last five days of spring training.", "The players went into the hospitals and spoke to the wounded soldiers before and after the games.", "Players in the League eagerly supported the War effort.", "Several of the players had husbands and brothers overseas and many had relatives in the service.", "This war effort brought a lot of positive publicity national press to the League.", "The All-Americans celebrated the end of World War II on August 14, 1945, at the ballpark.", "The war ended but the All-American Girls Professional Ball League was in full swing.", "By the end of the season, attendance reached 450,313.", "## Post War Years", "A Team of Junior Racine Belles", "Life was great.", "The All-American host cities organized Junior Leagues for young girls 14 years and older.", "The teams traveled to exotic locations for spring training: Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1946; Havana, Cuba in 1947; and Opalocka, Florida in 1949.", "The rules were modified each year to lengthen infield distances and approve first side-arm pitching (1946) and overhand pitching (1948).", "The League acquired franchises for two more teams in Peoria, Illinois and Muskegon, Michigan, and a four-team minor league was established in Chicago as the Chicago Girls Baseball League (CGBL).", "Ambitious post-season tours to Cuba and South America were organized as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball.", "The Springfield (Illinois) Sallies and Chicago Colleens were added to the League's roster in 1948 but lost their franchises by the end of that season.", "For the next two years the Colleens and Sallies became rookie training teams that played exhibition games and recruited new talent as they toured through the South and East.", "Highlights of these tours included contests in Washington, D.C.'s Griffith Park and New York's Yankee Stadium.", "In the first three years after World War II, teams often attracted between two and three thousand fans to a single game.", "One League highlight occurred when an estimated 10,000 people saw a 1946 Fourth of July double-header in South Bend, Indiana.", "The AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1948 season, when ten teams attracted 910,000 paid fans.", "However, attendance declined in the following years.", "One of the reasons for decreasing attendance and a resulting decrease in revenues was the decentralization of the League.", "At the end of the 1950 season, team directors voted to purchase the AAGBBL from Arthur Meyerhoff and operate their teams independently.", "Max Carey resigned as League President and was replaced by his assistant, Fred Leo.", "With no centralized control of publicity, promotion, player procurement, and equalization of player talent, the League began to break down.", "Individual team owners' financial circumstances declined and hindered their ability to operate on deficit spending resulting from declining attendance.", "The shrinking of the local fan base resulted in part from the rise of other forms of recreation and entertainment and the advent of televised major league games in the early 1950s.", "In addition, by this time the All-American game was purely baseball and talented women baseball players were not easy to find.", "Talented softball players needed training and experience for success in the All-American baseball game with its longer infield distances, smaller ball, and overhand pitching.", "As revenues fell, individual teams were no longer able to support rookie training teams like the Colleens and Sallies, and funds were limited to advertise nationally as a way of recruiting scattered baseball talent.", "By 1952, only six teams remained in the league after Kenosha and Peoria were disbanded.", "In 1953, the Battle Creek team was relocated to Muskegon, and by the end of the season, it too, folded.", "The 1954 season ended with only five teams remaining: Fort Wayne, South Bend, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, and Rockford.", "The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained.", "The League operated from 1943 to 1954 and represents one of the most unique aspects of our nation's baseball history.", "Scroll To Top", "Copyright \u00a9 2018

War raged thousands of miles away, Armstrong and her teammates packed minor league ballparks and lifted war-weary spirits through the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Armstrong found that out firsthand when she and some of her high school teammates organized their own team. The manager of one of the teams they played offered her a spot on the Garfield Flashettes of New Jersey. She accepted and soon learned that he was a scout for the AAGPBL. After that Armstrong attended a try out, which was a success, and was a signed a contract. For her labor, she earned $200 a week with room and board taken care of by the team, because the girls stayed with families during the regular season. Armstrong entered the league in 1952 with the Rockford Peaches, pitching for them in that season while she was still in high school. She posted a 4-1 record in six starts and three relief appearances. Managed by Bill Allington, the Peaches featured top-notch players as Eleanor Callow, Rose Gacioch, Carol Habben, Alice Pollitt and Ruth Richard."}}

thought, 'We are well and truly screwed here'.\"", "She laughs loudly.", "\"But by then it was too late.\"", "We talk about the line between exploitation and documentary; did Billingham worry about crossing it when he photographed his family?", "\"Not really.", "That's why you put them in a gallery,\" he says.", "\"You frame them in a certain way to allow a particular reading of them.", "But now you have the internet, the pictures are all there out of context\u2026\"", "Does that bother him?", "\"With the photographs I tried to make them as truthful as I could and hopefully that element overcomes any exploitative element,\" he says.", "\"I think there was a warmth to them.\"", "Talking to Billingham you can't help but wonder how he saw a way of making the riotous mundanity of his family into art.", "It's one thing, as in Benefits Street, to have a film crew from outside looking in; it's another to be able to frame your own life.", "He talks a bit about \"objectifying my

"History.:Naming.", "claim_context": "Struve came out in favour of the name \"Neptune\" on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Soon, \"Neptune\" became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for Earth, were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology. \n Most languages today use some variant of the name \"Neptune\" for the planet; indeed in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"sea king star\" (\u6d77\u738b\u661f). In Mongolian, Neptune is called \"Dalain Van\" (\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called \"Poseidon\" (\u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, \"Poseidonas\"), the Greek counterpart of Neptune."}}

Julia BrokawMusicMusic", "# 1989", "A-A-", "# 1989", "## Artist", "Ryan Adams", "## Label", "PAX-AM/Blue Note", "Ryan Adams goes wherever his muse directs him, which explains why he's just as likely to release a hardcore EP as he is an alt-country masterpiece.", "But when news broke that he had decided to put his own spin on Taylor Swift's 1989 (and was interpreting it in the style of the Smiths, no less), it was one of his more random, if not entirely unexpected, gestures.", "After all, Adams once made a blues version of the Strokes' 2001 debut, Is This It, which never saw the light of day, and he's decidedly un-snobbish about his musical likes.", "As it turns out, Adams was indeed serious about treating his version of 1989 with complete respect and reverence.", "The finished product is decidedly free of irony or shtick, and, perhaps more important for a covers album, transforms the source material.", "Swift's 1989 felt upbeat and empowering, though its lyrics touched on damaging breakups, irresistible bad decisions, and romantic regrets, because she never gave up hope that things might work out in her favor.", "Adams' interpretation of 1989 is a case of seeing the glass half empty: He operates under the assumption that things are irrevocably damaged, and responds accordingly.", "And so the \"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\"-esque acoustic posturing of \"Out Of The Woods\" exacerbates the song's uncertainty about a relationship's status; the reverb-slathered, minor-key jangle of \"All You Had To Do Was Stay\" is contorted by anguish, not desperation; and the conspiratorial acoustic riffs, string shivers, and falsetto-kissed vocal delivery of \"Blank Space\" are a eulogy to optimism.", "Even the relentless pep talk \"Shake It Off\" is an unconvincing attempt at breaking out of personal doldrums.", "This approach to 1989 works so well in part because Adams tends to be at his best when he's wallowing in heartbreak.", "But it's also successful because he doesn't overstate this interpersonal drama.", "The 1989 arrangements (and the moody contributions of La Sera guitarist Tod Wisenbaker, who collaborated with Adams on the album) are sparse and restrained, with plenty of space for melancholy to linger and resonate.", "Watercolor-hued strings and well-placed percussion thumps creep into the acoustic-ruffled \"How You Get The Girl\"; \"Bad Blood\" is the quintessential Adams-style alt-country shuffle; and \"This Love\" becomes a chilling piano ballad.", "The much-ballyhooed Smiths influence is also rather seamless, especially on the sighing rainy day riffs on \"Wildest Dreams\" and dreampop jam \"I Wish You Would.\"", "(The flamenco guitar splashes and rattlesnake percussion on \"I Know Places,\" however, firmly resemble modern-day solo Morrissey.)", "Yet 1989 is more than just a Moz homage.", "As with 2014's Ryan Adams, there's also a strong Springsteen vibe: \"Shake It Off\" nicks the tick-tock drumming and solemn midnight ambience of \"I'm On Fire,\" while Adams' clenched-teeth vocal delivery and salt-of-the-earth strums on \"Welcome To New York\" are classic Boss signifiers.", "And another highlight, the raucous \"Style,\" is a yearning, '80s college rock fever dream with snarling punk stabs \u00e0 la Sonic Youth.", "In a sense, Adams has created the soundtrack to a fictional '80s teen movie.", "Still, what his version of 1989 does best is illustrate the strength of the source material.", "With the radio-ready gloss stripped away, these songs compare to the best moments in Swift's back catalog.", "For fans, this isn't a new revelation: Despite the sleeker production, Taylor's 1989 themes didn't stray that far from her roots, just reflected the fact that she's matured.", "Adams will receive a reputation boost and a boatload of new Twitter followers thanks to the support of loyal Swifties, which is completely deserved.", "But his 1989 is also a stark reminder that Swift's songwriting continues to deserve respect and kudos.", "## You may also like", "#### Mirai Nagasu Just Became the First American Woman to Land a Triple Axel in the Winter Olympics", "51 minutes agoThe

October 27, 2014.

Swift also included the song on the set list for her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, where she performed \"Style\" as part of a medley with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\". On April 23, 2019, Swift performed an acoustic version of the song at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts during the \"Time\" 100 Gala, where she was honored as one of the \"100 most influential people\" of the year. \n Rock singer Ryan Adams covered \"Style\" on his 2015 track-by-track cover album of Swift's \"1989\". Adams changed the original James Dean-referenced lyric to \"You've got that '\"Daydream Nation\"' look in your eye\", a tribute to 1980s rock band Sonic Youth. He also incorporated rock-oriented styles, which were compared to works by Irish rock band U2 and its lead singer Bono."}}

universities and main schools but this only served to galvanize university students as one of the driving force of protest against the regime and the students put pressure on the traditionally divided

support, the Bangladeshi police began to refuse to comply with Ershad's order to fire on demonstrators.", "Ershad agreed to step down on 4 December.", "After Ershad was removed from power, a three-month neutral transitional government headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Shahabuddin Ahmed, declared a state of emergency, restored civil liberties, and was responsible for

marking the beginning of a persistent two-party system in Bangladesh.", "The elections ultimately resulted in a BNP government, and Khaleda Zia was sworn in as Bangladesh's prime minister.", "However, since elections were held in 1991, political contests between the AL and BNP have been mainly fueled by personal rivalry between the parties' leaders instead of being issue-oriented.", "Bangladesh's

In addition to these six, there are locations in Disneyland (Main Street, U.S.A.), Disney California Adventure (Buena Vista Street), Anaheim's Downtown Disney, and Disney Village at Disneyland Paris. The Downtown Disney and Disney Springs locations are Starbucks-operated, while the locations inside of the theme parks are Disney-operated. \n Bill Sleeth, Starbucks' vice president of global design, has overseen efforts to make a neighborhood feel for new stores, saying \"What you don't want is a customer walking into a store in downtown Seattle, walking into a store in the suburbs of Seattle and then going into a store in San Jose, and seeing the same store.\" Sleeth said \"The customers were saying, 'Everywhere I go, there you are,' and not in a good way. We were pretty ubiquitous.\" As part of a change in compact direction, Starbucks management wanted to transition from the singular brand worldwide to focusing on locally relevant design for each store. \n Starbucks' first Channel Island store was opened in early 2015, in the primary business area of St Peter Port in Guernsey."}}

She first appeared in \"All the King's Men\", a political thriller set in 1940s Louisiana, featuring Sean Penn and Jude Law. She played the supporting part of the love interest to Law's character. The film received negative reviews for its lack of political insight and narrative cohesiveness, and failed to recoup its US$55 million investment. Her next release, the drama \"Little Children\", was better received. Based on the novel of the same name, the film tells the story of Sarah Pierce, an unhappy housewife who has an affair with a married neighbour (played by Patrick Wilson). Winslet was challenged by the role of an uncaring mother, as she did not understand or respect her character's actions. Scenes requiring her to be hostile towards the child actress playing her daughter proved upsetting for her. Having given birth to two children, Winslet was anxious about the sex scenes in which she had to be nude; she took on the challenge to present a positive image for women with imperfect bodies. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Winslet successfully \"registers every flicker of Sarah's pride, self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and concern\"."}}

Although she participated in a few group exhibitions (the biggest was organized by Herman Gulack in 1958 at the Greenwich Gallery), there was little positive reaction to her work. After her husband died in 1967, Jo bequeathed her entire artistic estate (and that of her husband) to the Whitney Museum of American Art. However, the museum discarded most of her work and has never shown any of it since her death in 1968; only a few of her works survive and a few more are known from photographs Jo made, as reproduced in Levin. \n Additional works by Josephine Nivison Hopper have continued to surface, as reported by Elizabeth Thompson Colleary. Jo's watercolors were exhibited at the Edward Hopper House Art Center, Nyack, NY, in 2014 and a few examples were included in an exhibition of \"Edward Hopper as Illustrator\" at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, MA, also in 2014.

Children born out of wedlock suffered from poor care. \n The \"Loi sur les Asiles d'ali\u00e9n\u00e9s\" (Lunatic Asylum Act) of 1909 governed mental institution admissions until 1950. The law stated the insane could be committed for three reasons: to care for them, to help them, or as a measure to maintain social order in public and private life. However, the act did not define what a disruption of social order was, leaving the decision to admit patients up to the psychiatrists. The Quebec government received subsidies from the federal government for building hospitals, but hardly anything for having orphanages. Government contributions were only $1.25 a day for orphans, but $2.75 a day for psychiatric patients, providing a strong financial incentive for reclassification."}}

utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division \"Time Warner Entertainment\" (or legally \"Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.\"). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable. \n In October 1996, Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting System, which was established by Ted Turner. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950 film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution), while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties. \n Time Warner completed its purchase of Six Flags Theme Parks in 1993 after buying half of the company in 1991, saving it from financial trouble. The company was later sold to Oklahoma-based theme park operator Premier Parks under certain terms and conditions on April 1, 1998."}}

insisting that everybody pours over the lyric sheet, but if you don't get that, you're kind of losing a lot.\"", "Considering his attention to detail, it's no surprise that from garage bandleader to dance sensation, McAloon has always looked to master songwriters of an earlier era for inspiration.", "And despite a penchant for Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, he reserves his highest praise for the work of men such as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and Richard Rodgers.", "\"I think to deliver your heartaches with panache is really quite moving,\" he says in reference to the lyrics of Lorenz Hart's

one which played a significant role in dragging England into a horrific civil war.", "### Richard, Duke of York", "The respective rises of York and Somerset was surprising, given the differences in both men's upbringing, but nonetheless the great rivals grew to harbour the same all-encompassing ambitions.", "Richard of York had an illustrious lineage, descended from Edward III twice over through the great king's second son Lionel, Duke of Clarence (though in the female line) and fourth son Edmund, Duke of York.", "It was a pedigree that arguably provided York with a superior claim to the throne than the incumbent Lancastrian dynasty, themselves descended from Edward III's third son, John of Gaunt (albeit crucially in the direct male line).", "Born on 21 September 1411, York's early life was tainted by his father's execution for treason by Henry IV when he was three, although he subsequently benefited as heir from the demise of his paternal uncle Edward, Duke of York, in 1415 and his maternal uncle Edward Mortimer, Earl of March, in 1425.", "When he reached 21 in 1432, Richard came into full custody of his inheritance, an array of titles that included the Duchy of York as well as the Earldoms of Cambridge, Ulster and March.", "Fully expecting a career in front-line politics, York was instead deployed to France in 1436 to serve as lieutenant, a tenure which finally expired in 1445.", "Having been deprived his lucrative post overseas by the king's failure to renew his lieutenancy, York returned to England where he soon grew outspoken against the plans of Henry VI and his chief councillor William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, to attempt peace with France.", "As a result, York was appointed lieutenant of Ireland in 1447, a position intended to remove him from the political scene.", "Richard Duke Of York, c 1450.", "(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)", "Departing in June 1449, he wouldn't remain across the Irish Sea for long.", "The following year,

Chichester, and the Duke of Suffolk.", "In June 1450, a popular uprising led by a shadowy figure named Jack Cade caused further disarray throughout the land, prompting the celebrated return of York to the mainland in September, assuming the mantle as champion of the common man.", "It was a return that set him directly against the man who had replaced Suffolk as the king's second-in-command: Edmund Beaufort.", "### Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset", "Unlike York, Somerset could not boast of a considerable inheritance and a collection of noble titles, but he did share descent from Edward III.", "The Beauforts were an illegitimate brood born to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and a third son of King Edward.", "When Gaunt's eldest legitimate heir, Henry of Bolingbroke usurped the throne in 1399 to become Henry IV \u2013 the first Lancastrian sovereign \u2013 his Beaufort half-siblings, who had been retrospectively legitimised more than two decades after their birth, rose with him.", "Edmund's father John Beaufort, one of Henry IV's half-brothers, had been raised to the earldom of Somerset in 1397, a title which passed to his own heir Henry after the first earl's death in 1410 and consequently to his second son John after Henry's premature demise in 1418.", "The younger John Beaufort spent most of his life in French captivity after being caught after the battle of Baug\u00e9 in 1421, with his younger brother Edmund overseeing the family interests back in England.", "The younger John Beaufort, the 3rd Earl, was finally ransomed in 1438 and soon incurred the enduring enmity of Richard of York after he led an army into France in 1443, receiving men, money and resources denied to York, the lieutenant across the Channel.", "When John, elevated to the dukedom of Somerset that year to rival York's status, failed to take advantage of the opportunity granted him, he returned to England and died in uncertain circumstances the following year, leaving Edmund to once again pick up the pieces.", "The seeds of discord between York and the Beauforts had, however, already been sown, a feud which swiftly accelerated over the next decade.", "When York's tenure as lieutenant in France ended in 1445, the lucrative post was handed to John's younger brother Edmund, who was also raised from earl to duke of Somerset, a sign of his increasing prominence.", "Somerset's spell in France, however, proved disastrous and by 1450, he had overseen the complete loss of all English possessions in Normandy, including York's favoured fortress of Rouen, the mightiest in the region.", "Somerset's reputation collapsed amongst some of the nobility in England, particularly York, although he was infallible in the eyes of the man who mattered: Henry VI.", "When York returned from Ireland in September 1450, a clash with Somerset was inevitable.", "Quite simply, both dukes could not coexist peacefully, nor did either have any inclination to do so.", "York's intention was to assume command of the government on behalf of the unstable king, replacing the fallen Suffolk and re-establishing good governance and financial probity to the realm.", "York, however, was politely rebuffed, only to frustratingly see Edmund Beaufort handed such authority.", "### Rising rivalries between York and Beaufort", "In the November 1450 parliament, York's chamberlain William Oldhall attacked Somerset as speaker of the Commons, alleging the duke was abusing his position to the \"grete hurt, and trouble of the liege people of this your Reame\".", "Oldhall demanded Somerset \"be removed from youre most noble presense, persone and estate\" by 1 December, and forbidden from coming within 12 miles of the king.", "King Henry ignored such demands, however, which almost led to

after.", "This fact has often been touted as evidence that the Neanderthals were a divergent outgroup that left no genetic heritage to modern human populations.", "The Neanderthal face is distinctive for its significant midfacial prognathism.", "Features involved in this prognathism include a very anterior midface, retreated zygomatics, anterior position of the dentition, and the anterior position of the nasal aperture.", "Evidence that the zygomatics have retreated is seen in that pre-Neanderthals have the M1 at the root of the zygomatic, with Neanderthals having the M3 at the root of the

The earliest bipedal hominin is considered to be either \"Sahelanthropus\" or \"Orrorin\", with \"Ardipithecus\", a full bipedal, coming somewhat later. The knuckle walkers, the gorilla and chimpanzee, diverged around the same time, and either \"Sahelanthropus\" or \"Orrorin\" may be humans' last shared ancestor with those animals. The early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines and later the genus \"Homo\". There are several theories of the adaptational value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed up the hands for reaching and carrying food, because it saved energy during locomotion, because it enabled long distance running and hunting, or as a strategy for avoiding hyperthermia by reducing the surface exposed to direct sun. \n The human species developed a much larger brain than that of other primates\u2014 typically  1,330\u00a0cm (81\u00a0cu\u00a0in) in modern humans, over twice the size of that of a chimpanzee or gorilla."}}

prove the point, he and his partner at the time, Maureen Enns, a photographer and artist, spent months each year for a decade living among bears in a remote part of eastern Russia.", "They wrote several books based on those experiences and were the subject of documentaries and countless articles.", "Mr. Russell's ideas, though, were not embraced by everyone.", "Some fellow naturalists worried that they might lead people to be unwisely casual around wild animals.", "And in Russia, Mr. Russell ran afoul of criminal elements and corrupt politicians tied to bear poaching.", "His and Ms. Enns's experiment on the Kamchatka Peninsula ended heartbreakingly.", "When they returned there for the 2003 season, they found that almost all the bears they had become acquainted with were gone, presumably slaughtered.", "A bear gallbladder \u2014 the prize for poachers, valued in some countries as an aphrodisiac and general health remedy \u2014 had been nailed to their cabin wall, like some kind of warning.", "\"The bears were killed so we would go home,\" Mr. Russell told The Globe and Mail in July 2003.", "\"It is a brutal ending to our research.\"", "But he continued to promote his views, and they have influenced policy and practice in areas where bears and people encounter one another.", "\"His work with bears was groundbreaking,\" Kevin Van Tighem, an author and former superintendent of

might last three weeks.", "Andy Russell was also a noted naturalist and writer, and when he decided to make a documentary about the white subspecies of black bears on Princess Royal Island in British Columbia, he took Charlie and his brother Richard along as assistants.", "The experience, Charlie said later, helped him begin to think differently about bears.", "The three found that they were mostly capturing footage of bears' backsides as the animals ran from them \u2014 until they left their rifles behind when they went out to film.", "\"The three of us eventually came to the conclusion that bears could sense that we were not a threat,\" Mr. Russell told The Edmonton Journal in 2002, \"that somehow they realized that without a gun, we would do them no harm.\"", "Mr. Russell became a rancher on the family land in Alberta, and he began to wonder if the traditional rancher view of bears as an enemy was fair.", "Mr. Van Tighem said that Mr. Russell, who had no college education, was not interested in studying bears in the usual way.", "\"Anybody can become a bear 'expert' by reading about them and sitting through lectures at a university,\" Mr. Van Tighem said.", "\"Charlie wasn't that kind of expert.", "He didn't see bears in the way that other bear researchers might \u2014 as objects of study.", "He saw them as his teachers.\"", "But to really get at the innate nature of bears, he needed to find ones that had no history of negative encounters with people.", "That is what sent him and Ms. Enns to Kamchatka, which had been off limits to civilians for military reasons during the Cold War and thus was full of bears that had had no contact with humans.", "They first scouted the area in 1994.", "In 1996, Russian officials granted them permission to build a cabin near a remote lake.", "They flew in every year, using a small plane Mr. Russell had built from a kit, and stay for four or five months.", "The bears grew to know them, Mr. Russell said, and became comfortable enough with them that sometimes a few would come to the cabin and linger to see if he and Ms. Enns wanted to go for a walk with them.", "The couple also won permission to bring in three orphaned cubs from a Russian zoo to try to reintroduce them to the wild, and they succeeded despite the skepticism of some naturalists.", "They eventually worked with a total of 10 orphaned cubs.", "While elsewhere in the world naturalists were studying bears by tranquilizing them and putting trackers on them, or doing chemical analysis of their blood and bodily wastes, Mr. Russell wanted no

miles a bear walks in a day or how many mouthfuls of grass it eats,\" he told Backpacker magazine.", "He cared, he said, about only two things: what annoyed bears and what didn't.", "His conclusion that bears were not naturally hostile to people earned him enemies among hunters.", "\"A lot of it is because the hunting culture needs to promote an animal as fearful so that people can feel brave about killing it,\" he told the Australian newspaper The Age in 2009.", "His live-with-the-bears approach also drew criticism from some wildlife officials.", "\"He's teaching people how to get

Charlie and his three brothers learned about the wilderness from their father, assisting him as adventure guides and cameramen. His brothers went to college and became biologists, while Charlie became a rancher. But he was fascinated by grizzly bears, trying to overcome their image as savage killers by making his cattle ranch open to grizzlies and leading ecotourists on bear-viewing trips (as opposed to hunting which had previously been the objective of grizzly tours). He has tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to convince wildlife officials to treat bears with respect and trust, arguing that it is people's fear of bears and aggressive actions toward them that makes them dangerous. \n Russell is best known for his ten years of field work in Kamchatka, where he taught local guides how to lead bear-viewing tours. He began to buy orphaned grizzly cubs from zoos, taking them into remote areas of Kamchatka and teaching them to be wild. He has been the subject of two television documentaries: \"Walking with Giants: The Grizzlies of Siberia\" (PBS, 1999) and \"Bear Man of Kamchatka\" (BBC, 2006)."}}

George Harrison was \"the Beatles' Third Man, always there yet somehow elusive\".", "As well as being the \"quiet Beatle\", he was the rock guitarist who introduced the sitar to British pop music, a stalwart devotee of transcendental meditation, a film producer and an underrated songwriter - his composition Something was recorded by dozens of singers and was the only Beatles song featured in concert by Frank Sinatra.", "He was born in Wavertree, Liverpool in 1942, eight months after Paul McCartney and two years after John Lennon.", "He experienced his \"rock 'n roll epiphany\", he later recalled, \"when I was about 12 or 13 riding my bike and I heard Heartbreak Hotel coming out of somebody's house.\"", "The son of a bus driver, George passed the 11-plus exam and was awarded a place at the Liverpool Institute, one of the city's leading grammar schools.", "He met McCartney, who lived nearby, on the bus to school and the pair became close friends.", "When Paul linked up with John in the Quarrymen skiffle group, he tried to persuade the group to invite George to join.", "Lennon resisted, unwilling to have a 14- year-old kid in his band.", "He relented after hearing George's acoustic guitar rendition of the rock hit Raunchy.", "He realised that having a guitar soloist would allow the group to incorporate rock 'n roll material by Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Little Richard into its repertoire.", "The disapproval with which Lennon's Auntie Mimi greeted George's teddy boy style and thick Scouse accent may also have helped change John's mind.", "Harrison's absorption in music took its toll on his school career, and he left the Liverpool Institute in 1959 with only one exam pass, in art.", "However, the following year his musical career began in earnest when the re-named Beatles were booked to play for four months in a club in Hamburg's Reeperbahn.", "Although the trip was cut short when the 17-year-old Harrison was discovered to be under age, the quintet (including drummer Pete Best and guitarist Stuart Sutcliffe) had gelled into an arresting and idiosyncratic unit.", "By 1962, the Beatles had signed their recording contract with EMI.", "When their urbane producer, George Martin, politely asked them whether there was \"anything you're not happy with?\", Harrison quipped: \"Yes, I don't like your tie\".", "The next eight years saw the Beatles become the most famous entertainers in the world and then implode.", "George had his share of the adulation - on his 21st birthday he received 15,000 cards and a full-sized door plus key - but within the group he was relatively isolated, as John and Paul were locked into their volatile songwriting partnership.", "Nevertheless, his contribution was considerable.", "He designed guitar breaks and riffs to suit the range of song genres used by Lennon and McCartney, although he had less opportunity than he would have liked to cut loose in the rockabilly style of his great hero Carl Perkins.", "He also got to sing at least one number on each album, beginning with Do You Want To Know A Secret? on the debut album.", "Eventually, too, the Beatles agreed to record his compositions, of which Within You Without You (from Sgt Pepper) While My Guitar Gently Weeps (from the White Album) and Here Comes The Sun and Something (from Abbey Road) were among the most memorable.", "But probably his most important influence on the group concerned the new sound textures he introduced.", "Chief among these was the sitar that he first heard in a scene from the film Help!", "George was intrigued and he contrived a meeting with the sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar at the home of the leader of the Asian Music Circle in London.", "He briefly studied with Shankar, not, as he explained, to be able to become a classical raga player, but to be able to use the sitar in Beatle music.", "It was first heard on the Lennon song Norwegian Wood in 1965 and soon Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and a dozen other pop musicians were featuring the sitar sound instrument on their records.", "Harrison and Shankar remained close friends, touring the United States together in 1974, and a Shankar recording appeared on Harrison's own record label, Dark Horse.", "George's interest in Indian music led to the Beatles' famous entanglement with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967-8.", "With the other group members and their partners, George and his wife Patti Boyd (whom he had met on the set of the film A Hard Day's Night) travelled to the Maharishi's ashram in India.", "When the event disintegrated after allegations that the guru had molested a female adept, Harrison alone of the group remained faithful to the precepts of the Vedic tradition.", "He later showed his commitment in more practical ways by producing a hit record by the London-based Hari Krishna Temple group, by donating a Hertfordshire mansion for use as a centre of Hinduism and by playing concerts in support of the Natural Law party.", "He did, however, turn down the Maharishi's request that he, Paul and Ringo stand as candidates in Liverpool in the 1992 general election.", "By 1968, The Beatles were on a downward path as John and Paul drifted apart and both antagonised George, who walked off the set of the film Let It Be after an argument with Paul.", "In these circumstances, it was perhaps not surprising that Harrison was the first of the group to record and succeed as a solo artist.", "He made two instrumental albums - Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound - before co-producing the three-LP set All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector and a range of distinguished instrumentalists.", "With 3m copies sold worldwide, it was his most commercially successful record, although a successful plagiarism suit over the song My Sweet Lord eventually cost him almost $600,000 (\u00a3421,000) in a US court case.", "The devastation caused by floods in Bangladesh in 1971 inspired Harrison to organise a major benefit concert in New York that was recorded and released as a live album the following year.", "He continued to write and record at a fast pace for the next few years, releasing the hit Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth) in 1973 and the albums Living In The Material World and Extra Texture.", "By the late 1970s, however, his spiritual soft rock was out of fashion and for much of the next decade Harrison concentrated on a new career as a film producer through Handmade Films, the company he formed with Dennis O'Brien in 1979.", "Their first success was the Monty Python's feature The Life Of Brian, which they took on after EMI's Lord Delfont decided it would incur charges of blasphemy.", "During the 1980s Handmade was responsible for such critically-acclaimed movies as The Long Good Friday, Time Bandits, A Private Function, Mona Lisa and Withnail and I.", "The failure of the Madonna-Sean Penn vehicle Shanghai Surprise in 1986 heralded a downturn in the company's fortunes and it was eventually wound up in acrimony with Harrison winning a $11 million lawsuit against his former partner.", "John Lennon's tragic death in 1980 spurred George to compose the tribute song All Those Years Ago which he recorded with Paul and Ringo, but his own recording career was not rekindled until 1987 when he and Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra co-produced the album Cloud Nine which included two hit singles, Got My Mind Set On You (a number one in America) and When We Was Fab.", "With Lynne he next formed the Travelling Wilburys, a kind of anti-supergroup with Bob Dylan (a former songwriting partner of Harrison's), Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.", "Despite Orbison's death in 1988, the group recorded two highly successful albums that in 1992 encouraged Harrison to undertake his first international tour for 18 years.", "Among the supporting musicians was Eric Clapton, whose professional and personal life had been entwined with Harrison's since the 1960s.", "After George and Patti Boyd had separated in 1974 she married Clapton, whose agonised love for her had inspired his famous song Layla.", "In his 1979 autobiography I Me Mine, Harrison had written \"I don't go out to clubs and parties.", "I stay at home and watch the river flow\".", "In the 80s and early 90s he appeared in public infrequently, usually on Beatle-related occasions such as the court case in which the surviving Beatles prevented the release of a sub-standard live recording from Hamburg and at Linda McCartney's funeral.", "During the remainder of the 90s, Harrison lived quietly in his lovingly restored 19th century mansion in Friars Park, Henley-on-Thames, with his second wife Olivia Arias and their 24-year-old son Dhani.", "Their idyllic life was shaken when a schizophrenic Beatles fan, Michael Abram, broke into their home in December 1999.", "Although he badly injured Harrison, he was found not guilty of attempted murder and was ordered to be detailed indefinitely in a secure psychiatric hospital.", "A year before the attack, Harrison, previously a heavy smoker, had revealed he had undergone treatment for throat cancer.", "After the break-in, Harrison developed lung cancer and received major surgery for the disease in America earlier this year.", "His death follows last-hope treatment in Switzerland for a tumour on his brain.",

The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt the school \"moulded [students] into being frightened\". \n Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences."}}

"SARAH MOLINOFF", "The animator, illustrator, and director Michael Dudok de Wit was born in 1953 in the Netherlands and now lives in London.", "He studied film and animation at the West Surrey College of Art and Design, and his work combines hand-drawn animation and watercolor, a sense of space and brushwork from China and Japan, and a unique use of film language.", "Dudok de Wit's shorts are known for their ability to convey the maximum amount of emotion, meaning, and humor in just a few animated brushstrokes.", "Even though his work loses much of its impact by being posted on sites such as YouTube, the Internet has ensured that his films can reach a wider audience than just those who go to animation or short film festivals.", "Dudok de Wit's animated short films appear around the world in festivals and have won numerous prizes.", "His best-known short is the moving eight-minute Father and Daughter (2000), which won a BAFTA, the 2001 Academy Award for Best Animated Short, and many other awards at festivals.", "The animation shows a girl whose father has left her, for unknown reasons, and at the end of her life they are reunited.", "The film tends to inspire intensely personal comments on websites where it is posted, both because of the poignant ending and the ambiguity surrounding the departure of the father, which allows the viewer to relate the film to his or her own story.", "The Monk and the Fish (1994), nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA, is a light-hearted story of a monk obsessed with catching a fish at his monastery.", "More economical in its delivery than Father and Daughter, the film expresses joy and humor not just in the plot but also in the image itself, aided by a tune from the Baroque composer Corelli.", "The film ends with the monk and the fish coming together.", "Dudok de Wit often experiments with unusual media and abstract settings, such as in The Aroma of Tea (2006), which was drawn with tea and depicts a small brown dot moving among lines, spirals, organic shapes, and other animated dots accompanied by affective music, again from Corelli.", "Despite the abstraction, the film seems to have a definite plot that hinges on the ability of the dot to find his way.", "Dudok de Wit's films attest to the profoundly emotive power of animation, as well as the continued value of the short as an artistic endeavor in itself, rather than a somehow lesser substitute for feature-length film.", "Can you begin by telling us about how you got into animation?", "It's quite easy, actually: I drew a lot as a kid, like most of my colleagues.", "So going to art college was an obvious choice, and then once I was at art college I realized how much I liked narrative art like film and comic strips, and combining art with sound and music.", "Then I specialized: I came to England to study animation.", "What really attracts me to animation is the use of film language.", "Not just timing and zooming in and panning, but also the more subtle use of film language, a language which is usually understood on a subconscious level by the audience.", "You can combine so many elements in such a rich way, not unlike cooking: it's not only the individual elements that count, but also the chemistry between them.", "I like how the end result can be very individualistic.", "With animation, because you work on every frame, literally every frame, you do it all consciously.", "You can really play with the subtleties of camera movement, timing, and so on.", "It's slow and laborious, but I think it's a beautiful language.", "Let's talk a bit about some of your films.", "What I find most interesting about The Monk and the Fish is how its comedic value is somehow inherent in the image.", "The disruption to the monk's life contrasts so comically with the soothing watercolors and beautiful music.", "How did you come up with the story?", "The genesis of the film was the ending.", "It was that sequence I wanted to create, where there is a serene union between the monk and the fish.", "The ending by itself would be flat, too abstract, to pull the audience in, so I clearly needed to have a build-up, to establish and feel empathy with the character.", "In contrast to the ending, in the beginning the monk is obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, but in the ending he arrives at a resolution.", "In a quiet way, not with a big act.", "I think it worked well like that.", "In addition, the chase of the monk and the fish was fun to animate.", "Part of the joy was creating the agitated movements and different variations.", "That sounds similar to what the Italian neorealist Rossellini said about his Germany Year Zero, that he created the whole film because he just wanted to shoot the scene at the end with the boy wandering abstractly through the rubble of Berlin.", "Ah, yes.", "Do you know Antonioni's The Passenger?", "It's one of my favorite films, and I think sometimes that he did the same.", "The music for The Monk and the Fish is perfect for the story.", "You adapted it from the Corelli, is that correct?", "Yes, it's a well-known musical theme, La Folia, adapted by Corelli, Vivaldi, Bach and other composers.", "I'd heard it on the radio many years before and I knew then that it would be perfect for an animated film because it has a whole range of emotions.", "It's basically one tune repeated over and over again, so you can mold it perfectly to what you want.", "So when I wrote The Monk and the Fish, I knew already that I wanted that music.", "I gave the composer a selection of recordings that I liked, mostly Corelli's and Vivaldi's variations.", "I said, \"These are the variations I like, this is the structure of the story, please make your version of it.\"", "Would you say there's a kind of moral at the end, about coming to terms with our environment and our obsessions?", "Yes, though I'm not certain about the word \"moral\".", "I'm not sure why you can't use that word.", "It's something finer than moral.", "Have you heard of the Ten Oxherding Pictures?", "It's a comic strip from China, very ancient, many centuries old, so not technically a comic strip.", "The pictures are well known, and there are many variations.", "It's basically Zen Buddhist or Taoist teaching condensed in a sequence of images.", "The story is about a man trying to catch a lost ox.", "He finds the ox, catches it, and you would think that this is the end of the story, but you're only halfway.", "The images that follow represent the essence of the Zen philosophy.", "It's very, very beautiful.", "That was the inspiration for the film, though the film doesn't go as far as these pictures because they are so profound that I can't reproduce the same sequence with my own authority.", "The Monk and the Fish is not a story about the solution of a conflict, it's more about the rise above the conflict, the rise above duality.", "So there isn't really a moral, it's more like another point of view.", "Much of your work uses a Chinese or Japanese style of brushwork.", "Did you grow up with such influences, or did you just come upon the style?", "I discovered the traditional Japanese brush art and calligraphy in my early twenties.", "The styles are so strong and so exquisite, it's easy to feel attracted to it.", "The Japanese in particular, and also the Chinese and the Koreans, have a way of using negative space, of not filling the picture, which is very typical of the Far East and very untypical of the West.", "We can be inspired by it, but it's profoundly in their culture\u2014in their genes maybe, and not so much in ours.", "It's not just about the brush line, it's also the space around the line that is inspiring.", "Some parts of The Monk and the Fish reminded me of Tove Jansson, who illustrated the Moomin books.", "Like hers, your drawings manage to be very expressive while using very few lines.", "That's a huge compliment\u2014I think the Moomin books are brilliant, just brilliant.", "You used tea to draw The Aroma of Tea.", "Did that start out as an experiment?", "Well, it's brush and ink, and originally it was going to be black ink.", "But the idea came out of the blue.", "I thought it would be nice to have a rich brown, and something with tea, which goes with the subject.", "There's something nice about using a technique which has not been used in animation yet.", "Again, though I also don't like the word moral, The Aroma of Tea does seem to be metaphorical for life in a way.", "We end up rooting for this little dot even though he looks like all the others.", "Yes, that would be correct.", "With Father and Daughter, I found that the spare quality of the imagery, perhaps this idea of \"negative space\", allowed room for the viewer to enter the story and assert his own history on the film by crawling into its spaces.", "You can find many highly personal interpretations online.", "What do you think of people projecting their narratives on the film?", "That's on purpose, and it's very tricky, because I want to be very clear and transparent and explicit.", "On the other hand, I want the individual who sees the film to relate it to his or her own experience and understanding.", "So for instance, a particular event in the story may be recognized by one individual as physical death, whereas another individual may not relate it to death at all.", "Both are right.", "It all depends on each person's own perception of death.", "You give people the opportunity to make their own interpretation, but it's dangerous, because it can also become a lazy way of storytelling.", "Almost like, \"I do what I like, and you figure it out yourself.", "I don't care.\"", "The wheels reminded me of clocks.", "It's a film about biking, in a way, and the wheels turn as the girl's clock runs out of time.", "That's interesting.", "I've used the bicycle wheel to reflect the circular quality of time, as in the changing of seasons, the changing of generations, and the music too has a circular quality\u2014it's a waltz.", "But I hadn't thought of actual clocks.", "It's true that traditional clocks indicate time in a circular way.", "Do you know anyone else who uses similar methods or is interested in similar things to you, such as experimenting with different media?", "Yes, many.", "The tragedy is that there are lots, and you wouldn't know unless you look for them.", "So you see them at animation festivals.", "And these days there are hundreds of animation festivals\u2014when I started there were just a handful.", "Or you can see them on the very rare programs dedicated to putting shorts together.", "Channel 4 was good at that.", "What do you think is the future of shorts?", "A good question, because I would never have guessed that something like YouTube would become so popular.", "In that sense, it's a massive opening for shorts.", "The other day, I looked there for a film from a colleague.", "It's a good film.", "In the old days, it would have been screened at festivals and have been seen by thousands of people.", "He puts it on YouTube, it got a lot of positive reactions, and now it's been seen by six million.", "This is a totally new direction.", "So to give you a short answer, yes, I think there is a future for shorts.", "But there are still a lot of people who see them as little exercises that you do before doing serious work like making feature films.", "And I don't see it like that at all.", "Shorts are more like poems, whereas features are more like novels.", "There's recently been a lot of talk about the revitalization of the short story.", "Many new collections are coming out.", "Yes, I think that's a good analogy.", "I'm not saying they inspire each other (I have seen a few animated shorts based on short stories, but not many), but there is a similarity there.", "Again, with short stories, people often consider them as exercises for the real stuff, which is a pity.", "The good thing about short films is that they are very individualistic, or can be, whereas feature films are diluted, purely because of the size of the team.", "A short animated film can be made almost alone, and even if there are ten people helping you, it can be very personal.", "You don't have to explain everything, you just do it because you feel right about it.", "And the British are generally good at appreciating individualism.", "Where would one go to see more animation?", "London has an animation festival in the summer.", "There's not one major festival in Britain, but three or four.", "Festivals are really the only way.", "I hesitate to say YouTube because some things suffer from the YouTube quality; they really do.", "Especially when the synchronization is a few frames out, and it completely destroys the sharp effect.", "So I hesitate to suggest it.", "Some films are fine on YouTube.", "I don't mean this disrespectfully, but animation like The Simpsons is fine on a small screen.", "I almost cry when I see Father and Daughter on YouTube!", "(Laughs).", "But then you have people in remote villages who see your films, people who may not have another opportunity to see independent short films.", "I would rather many people see them in poor quality than a few in high quality.", "Have you seen any Pixar features lately?", "Sometimes they show shorts before the feature.", "Yes, I saw Wall-E of course, though I can't remember the last short I saw.", "They are good.", "It's partly to do with the attitude.", "Pixar is a studio that feels that making shorts, giving directors the time to make a short, stimulates the creativity and the general ambiance.", "How many projects do you work on at any given time, and how long do your projects take to complete?", "It varies a lot.", "When I do a commercial, I often have to start immediately.", "I'll get a call asking me, \"Are you interested in this, we need to know now.\"", "And then often you start straight away, though sometimes you have to wait.", "Commercials can take two-four months, roughly.", "With short films, it's very different.", "Something might be in your head long before you actually put anything on paper.", "Once you start, once you've written a synopsis, figured out how to approach it, and then secured funding for it\u2026", "Altogether, my eight-minute film, Father and Daughter, took two years to make.", "Actually it was much longer, but I interrupted the work to teach.", "My six-minute film, The Monk and the Fish, took seven months to make.", "So you see there's no standard time frame.", "You mentioned the task of getting funding.", "What is the funding situation like for short films?", "Is there a lot available?", "It's very, very hard, because there is a supply, but there are many colleagues who apply for the same sources.", "Many short films you see in festivals, for instance, are student films.", "Students get the time and facilities they need to make their films.", "So students have an advantage?", "Yes.", "What do you think about technological developments in the media, such as the growth of CGI and digital media?", "How have such changes affected animation?", "Computer animation is clearly dominating the market, in shorts and in features.", "There was a time when people thought it would completely take over and that would be it.", "I never thought that would happen.", "I think hand-drawn animation will live side-by-side with CGI, and there are also lots of exciting hybrid versions.", "Basically, the digital developments have hugely

of their latest fragrance, WOMAN INTENSE, quite seriously.", "With Jessica Chastain as its Global Ambassador, they made a short film, Leading with Intensity, featuring an all-female cast and crew, for the brand's Lead Like a Woman initiative.", "The flick features Chastain and a group of female leaders\u2014including actor Jodi Balfour; actor and producer Alice Braga; chef Dominique Crenn; actor, director, writer and producer Zoe Lister-Jones; CEO and jewelry designer Jen Meyer; and philanthropist Kelly Sawyer; to name a few\u2014challenging what it means to be an intense woman, and the negative stereotypes that come along with that.", "The fragrance itself shows how intensity can be beautiful, and is the latest addition to the WOMAN franchise.", "Chastain tells us all about the campaign, plus why fragrance is personal to her.", "Jessica Chastain", "Lachlan Bailey", "Why did you decide to team up with Ralph Lauren Fragrances as the Global Ambassador of WOMAN?", "First of all, Ralph Lauren is a fashion brand and company that I really respect.", "I love the images of women that they put out.", "A woman in a suit is a very powerful image, and that's very exciting to me.", "In addition to that, partnering with them on this campaign and scent, WOMAN, coincides with everything I've ever said in every interview about how I feel about women in our society.", "I don't think there's anything that could have coincided better.", "What do you like about WOMAN INTENSE?", "I like the complexity and duality of it, the soft floral notes and the woody undertones.", "I think that's exactly what I like about the Ralph Lauren suit\u2014it's masculine, it's feminine, or I guess old fashioned ideas of what masculine and feminine are.", "To me, it's a scent that also could be unisex.", "It's really complex and interesting.", "How was working exclusively with an all-female cast and crew on the short film Leading with Intensity different without any men on set?", "I just felt relaxed and comfortable.", "I wasn't in a situation where I was hit over the head with the fact that it was an all-female cast and crew.", "It just felt easy and I think that's what all sets should feel like, no matter who is on set.", "There was a sense of camaraderie and everyone was there to create something special and we just got to work, down to business.", "What does \"lead like a woman\" mean to you personally?", "'Lead like a woman' to me is similar to 'fight like a girl.'", "'Fight' and 'lead' are verbs that in the past have been exclusively connected to men in our society in terms of our media, in terms of the way we talk about gender.", "And what it does is it actually empowers the word for women, and for women to acknowledge that it is their given right to lead.", "They don't have to adhere to an old stereotype of what a woman is supposed to be, because that is actually a very unhealthy society that keeps women out of leadership positions and it empowers female leadership.", "I think when we look at the statistics, empathy is one of the highest traits of a great leader and women have that in spades, so I think it's a very empowering call to action, lead like a woman.", "Which negative stereotype of being an \"intense\" woman would you most like to dispel of?", "It's an interesting thing when we talked about this, because before we had this discussion on set, I said for me 'intense' is something that relates to women and men, it's an adjective\u2014I am intensely loving, I am intensely ambitious.", "It just means to me going fully into your life, to live with intensity, to not back down, to go head first into whatever you're feeling or doing or participating in.", "It's to live life fully.", "There has been a lot of progress in the film industry, but as a staunch defender of gender equality, what other changes would you still like to see the most?", "The more we see women in power positions, the more changes will filter down the line.", "I think that's what we really, really need to tackle, which is why I'm so excited about Ralph Lauren doing that with this campaign, the Lead Like A Woman initiative.", "We need more female studio heads, we need more decision makers, we need more female directors because we know that in most cases, a woman in a leadership position hires other women in leadership positions.", "That is something I really, really want to tackle as we move into the future, not just in mine, but in all industries.", "Where are the women in power positions?", "Through your work with Ralph Lauren Fragrances, have you worked with the nonprofit Women In Film?", "I've always been associated with Women in Film from the beginning of when it first started, which is actually not that long ago.", "The most amazing thing is when I first signed on to this, I remember having a meeting with people involved in this whole campaign and they were talking to me about my industry and where they could put some resources and I brought up some very important organizations and Women In Film was one of them that helped to create equity in my industry.", "Ralph Lauren Woman Intense, RalphLauren.com", "Courtesy of Ralph Lauren Fragrances", "You're known for choosing roles with a feminist bent.", "How do you choose which roles to take on?", "I think it happens really naturally.", "Elizabeth Sloane in Miss Sloane, she would never define herself as a feminist, even though I do personally.", "I look for female characters that are pushing against an expectation of what society has planned for them because it's really interesting for me to play female characters that I recognize in my reality.", "I am constantly surrounded by these incredible women and I was just tired of not seeing women shown in media as they truly are.", "I'm definitely drawn to playing characters that embody reality.", "What have you learned about fragrance from working with Ralph Lauren Fragrances?", "In the past when I thought about fragrance I never really thought about the way it can truly make a difference.", "We are in an interesting time right now because when I started the gender boundaries and rules started to get blurred about what is masculine and what is inherently feminine and those lines; I think we're all questioning it.", "Through this collaboration with Ralph Lauren, I've realized that fragrance doesn't have to be essentially male or female.", "We're all different.", "What is feminine to me could be masculine to someone else.", "We're all our own definitions of what it is to be a woman.", "That's been a really eye-opening and exciting thing that I've learned that has coincided with Ralph Lauren.", "What are your favorite scents and smells?", "I love the smell of fresh cut grass.", "That always reminds me of my childhood.", "It's so good.", "Scent to me is very connected to memory and emotion and fresh cut grass just makes me feel like I'm 10 years old and you're playing outside and wishing the sun wouldn't set so you could just play outside forever.", "That's a very evocative smell for me and I love that smell.", "Behind the scenes with Jessica Chastain at the Ralph Lauren Woman Intense shoot", "Courtesy of Ralph Lauren Fragrances", "What's your earliest fragrance memory?", "My earliest fragrance memory probably would be my grandmother.", "My grandmother is the most glamorous woman I know.", "I remember she'd come and visit us, she always looked so beautiful and she always had this smell about her.", "But I didn't understand that because I was a little kid\u2014I just knew it was grandma's smell.", "And I remember sneaking into her bedroom and opening her drawers and smelling her sweaters because they still had her fragrance on them.", "I later found out she had a special perfume made for her and that's what was grandma's fragrance that I was remembering, but that was the first time that I understood that fragrance was a form of expression and it's something that coincides with who you are and what you want to project.", "How do you like to wear fragrance?", "It depends on what it is.", "It depends on where I'm going, it depends on what characters I'm working on.", "I have a different fragrance for each part that I play and I start wearing it when I'm at home prepping the part because like I said, fragrance is very connected to a deep, emotional memory to me, so if I'm working on something and in my subconscious I have this fragrance around me, when I'm on set and I use the fragrance it's going to bring everything back.", "I went to a yoga class this morning and I had a little jasmine oil because I thought that would help me in class.", "I use it in terms of what I feel I need in the moment.", "Which scent did you use to get into your character on X-Men: Dark Phoenix?", "That one I actually didn't wear anything.", "I can't reveal too much; for me it's something that wouldn't even be a scent that we could recognize.", "There's two different things: her true scent would be something that we weren't ever familiar with and then there's another scent that she'd wear that would make each of us feel immediately at peace and make us feel when we were around her like we were around anyone, someone who could just disappear into the crowd, so that's a complicated one for me, because there's an otherworldly quality about her.", "She would know what you were thinking and she would choose a fragrance that would remind you of your childhood.", "That's what she would smell like.", "For more of my stories on beauty, grooming and fashion, check out my page at Forbes.", "Follow me on Instagram and Twitter.", "Celia Shatzman", "Some kids dream of growing up and becoming President of the United States, or going into outer space.", "I, on the

In Anton Corbijn's \"A Most Wanted Man\", a thriller based on John le Carr\u00e9's novel, Hoffman played a German intelligence officer.

Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West. The incident was the subject of controversy and widespread media attention, resulting in many Internet memes. James Montgomery of MTV argued the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity\"."}}

kilograms of fossils gathered on the way back from the Pole; as well as Scott's diary, various letters to supporters, friends and the wives of his colleagues, and the famous Message To The Public.",

"Proposing a toast in 1910, Leonard Darwin, the son of Charles and president of the Royal Geographical Society, said: \"Captain Scott is going to prove once again that the manhood of the nation is not

"Wright later observed: \"If Scott hadn't been a naval man, he would have been a scientist; he had the mind of a scientist.\"", "The scientific staff were recruited by Scott and his friend and colleague Edward Wilson (\"Uncle Bill\"), and many went on to great eminence.", "Wilson himself was a doctor, who had been junior surgeon on Scott's 1901 Antarctic expedition on HMS Discovery.", "He was a deeply religious Christian who revered nature as the glory of God.", "An expert ornithologist and a phenomenally gifted artist, his illustrations of birds in Antarctica are among the Terra Nova expedition's great treasures.", "One of the most telling botanical items from the expedition was the fossilised Glossopteris, a fernlike plant known to grow in what was then called the Southern Continent (Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India).", "Along with the other samples of fossilised wood and leaves that were found in Scott and Wilson's tent, it proved that the climate in the Permian period, 250 million years ago, had been mild enough to support trees.", "But the discovery of the Glossopteris raised another question: had the Southern Continent and Antarctica once been one?", "In 1912, the German scientist Alfred Wegener had proposed his theory of continental drift, but few believed it.", "Only in the late Fifties was the movement of tectonic plates understood.", "For further proof of Scott and Wilson's devotion to science, consider the expedition to Cape Crozier.", "Scott's 1901 expedition had found a colony of Emperor penguins there, and Wilson had a burning desire to return to learn more.", "On June 27, 1911, he and \"Birdie\" Bowers \u2013 the other man whose body would be found in Scott's tent \u2013 embarked, with Apsley Cherry-Garrard, on what Wilson described as \"the weirdest bird's-nesting expedition that has ever been or ever will be\".", "It was a painful, five-week odyssey, the best example of the lengths to which Scott's men would go purely in the

only been visited before in daylight, and then with very great difficulty?\" asked Cherry-Garrard in his book The Worst Journey in the World.", "Because the Emperor penguin \u2013 which was six feet tall, never stepped on land, laid its eggs on ice during the winter, rested the eggs on its feet and pressed them to its abdomen for incubation \u2013 was \"probably the most primitive bird in the world\".", "After three weeks, during which they were sometimes unable to travel more than a mile a day, and the temperature could descend to -75F, they found the birds.", "\"We were witnessing a marvel of the natural world, and we were the first and only men who had ever done so,\" enthused Cherry-Garrard.", "\"We had within our grasp material which might prove of the utmost importance to science; we were turning theories into facts with every observation we made.\"", "Men had seen the Emperors before but never with their eggs; and they had never collected undamaged eggs containing embryos.", "Wilson believed they might reveal the missing evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds \u2013 he was wrong, but the surviving eggs and embryos remain much asked-for treasures of the Natural History Museum.", "Wilson would doubtless be pleased to know that the Emperor penguins, whose bodies they left in an igloo at Cape Crozier, were important control specimens in proving, 50 years later, that DDT had tainted the Antarctic atmosphere.", "When the survivors of Scott's expedition returned to Britain, in June 1913, much emphasis was put on its scientific achievements.", "Understandably so: while Scott was worshipped as a national hero, and Captain Oates as a martyr, they had been beaten to the Pole.", "Lord Curzon, the former Viceroy of India, declared that the publication of the expedition's scientific results would be the real monument to Scott and his men.", "That, perhaps, discounts the expedition's artistic legacy \u2013 Scott's journals; Cherry-Gerrard's account of the expedition and its tragic aftermath; Wilson's near-miraculous illustrations of birds; and The Great White Silence, the touching film made by expedition member Herbert Ponting.", "But the expedition's greatest scientific legacy is more substantial \u2013 namely, the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, founded in 1920 by Frank Debenham and Raymond Priestley, distinguished scientists who were in Scott's party, and initially financed by surplus donations to the fund for the expedition's widows and orphans.", "This fine international institution houses the

The subjects of the study were overweight Latino children, between the ages of eight and fifteen, residing in areas with elevated particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide levels, air pollutants caused nearby power plants and high-volume vehicle traffic. The results demonstrated that the children possessed significantly increased risk factors for Type 2 diabetes by the time they turned eighteen, such as diminished efficiency in the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. The insulin resistance that results from such a condition is a direct cause of diabetes onset. \n Diabetes mellitus is a disease that is characterized by the body's inability to properly regulate blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. Prolonged levels of high blood sugar may lead to severe health complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, blindness, or even early death."}}

Swift contacted him by text message roughly a month before the shooting; the two had known of each other through mutual friends. By the time they worked on the video, Sherwood had finished the film \"Take Down\", which was later renamed \"Billionaire Ransom\" (released in 2016).\n The video does not have a clear narrative but features disparate flashbacks of Swift and her love interest by the seashore, in the woods, and on car rides.

Media publications noted and praised the video's darker, more abstract and sensual atmosphere compared to the videos for \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space\".

They swept the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, a tradition that lives on with each Cup winner.

unhinged parties that were, according to Smith, \"legendary to anybody who was ever there.\"", "The music video for Oshin single \"Doused,\" a song about his complicated relationship with his father\u2014It stops and starts/ A gesture here and there...you blew it/ Now you've gone too far\u2014features the bandleader full-on sprinting through the moonlit streets of Brooklyn, hurrying to join the rest of the band thrashing around on the venue's stage.", "Today, 285's unmarked door has been shut for more than a year, and its neighboring DIY havens, Glasslands and Death By Audio, are closed too.", "(The building in which all three were located is now being rented by Vice.)", "By the time Oshin came out, in June of 2012, DIIV had a booking agent and didn't really need to play as many shows around town.", "With all the hype surrounding his project, Smith says he started feeling alienated from his peers in the scene.", "\"I walked into 285 Kent the day [the record] came out, and all these people are like, 'Hey man, congrats on Pitchfork.", "Best New Music!'", "I felt like they thought I was better than them, or that they thought I had a big head.", "Like, 'Why you?'", "I never really felt like a true part of [the community] after that.\"", "Today, the version of Brooklyn that DIIV outgrew doesn't really exist anymore\u2014at least not in Williamsburg.", "A few days after our first meeting, when I ask Smith to suggest a place to grab a drink, he arbitrarily chooses a yuppie-friendly bar called Black Bear, not realizing that it was constructed on the site of Public Assembly, a venue DIIV used to play before it closed, near the end of 2013.", "He may have picked it because it was a quick walk from his and Ferreira's apartment.", "More than likely, though, he just doesn't know where to go anymore.", "The next morning, on a sterile North Williamsburg block about half a mile from the old 285 Kent, Smith answers the door in only a beach towel.", "He dashes around the two-floor apartment with the energy of a kid before a field trip, his wet hair pulled into a messy high ponytail.", "Since he and Ferreira are moving soon, the place is a total wreck: the couch is hidden beneath piles of seemingly clean clothes, and there's an empty, sad-looking fish tank that dried up after Smith left it in the care of a flaky housesitter.", "The lower level is just as cluttered, with racks upon racks of Ferreira's chic clothing, plus a bare twin mattress and a flatscreen TV that doesn't work.", "\"Sky would kill me if she knew I let you in here,\" Smith says.", "After Bailey arrives, we cross the street to the parking lot where the DIIV van has been sitting dormant since the end of last year, when the band put touring on hold to concentrate on writing and recording the new LP.", "Smith says he had to pay $1700 in overdue fees to even be able to take it out.", "It's a little after 10AM, and the three of us are making the two-hour drive to Catskill to collect the last of Smith's stuff from his house up there.", "While waiting for the van's tires to fill up with air, Smith and Bailey play tic-tac-toe on the dust-covered window.", "On the road, the pair chat about writing Is the Is Are in January and February of this year, when Smith rented a warehouse and flew the whole band to L.A. to help him expand on the demos he had written alone.", "They're candid about the difficulties of collaborating with recently departed drummer Hewitt, who Smith says is a \"hardcore fucking drug addict\" and had trouble learning the new songs.", "(Via email, Hewitt denied drug use as the reason for his departure, citing instead a lack of steady income from the band and creative frustrations.", "\"I quit because I never really liked the music that much,\" he explained.)", "On DIIV's recent European tour, Oshin session drummer Ben Newman filled in.", "It's bright out, and Bailey is driving carefully on a winding, two-lane country highway with a jagged rock face running along its right shoulder.", "\"Colby just needs to figure his shit out,\" Smith says from the passenger seat.", "\"When I had my shit, I figured it out,\" Bailey adds, hinting at his own trip to a Georgia rehab facility, in 2013, after trying to quit drinking cold turkey sent him into a life-threatening withdrawal.", "\"This road freaks me out,\" Smith says suddenly.", "\"It's, like, falling apart.\"", "\"There's a lot of people around me who were doing really badly, and there were a lot of people around me doing well.", "And I knew which one I wanted to be.\"", "If you ask, Smith will tell you about getting high.", "He'll tell you that when tripping in groups, he prefers to drop the LSD a few minutes before everyone else so that he can be \"the leader,\" and he'll tell you about a time he spent staring mindlessly at a wall for 12 hours straight after trying meth in Los Angeles.", "He'll relay nerve-racking anecdotes about shooting up cocaine and cushioning the comedown with heroin, a sensation he likens to getting struck by a freight train and crash-landing in a pillow factory.", "\"There's an expression I always think about,\" he says: \"A smart man learns from his own mistakes; a wise man learns from others' mistakes.", "I've been able to apply that to my life in a lot of ways, but when it comes to drugs, I can't be told, 'Don't do it.'", "I have to try everything for myself.", "I couldn't live my life knowing that there was this insane experience that I was missing out on.\"", "When he started DIIV, Smith says he found himself surrounded by a lot of people using drugs, including smack.", "\"It was, like, everyone,\" he says of the particular clique of New York creative types he'd fallen into.", "Soon enough, he was using too.", "By 2013, Smith's growing addiction to heroin started to become a serious problem.", "At the peak of DIIV's popularity, a strung-out Smith couldn't give fans what they wanted most: new music.", "\"When I was getting fucked up all the time, I wrote literally zero songs,\" Smith remembers.", "He tried to pull it together, but even a single day without heroin can hurl an addict into a head-spinning, stomach-turning dope sickness.", "In the summer of 2013, an entire recording session with ex-Girls bassist and producer Chet \"JR\" White was scrapped.", "\"Quitting gets put off,\" Smith says, \"because there's never a good time to feel like fucking hell.\"", "After the arrest upstate, Smith was formally charged with a criminal misdemeanor for drug possession.", "In January of 2014, he left New York for an upscale detox facility in southern Connecticut that once treated the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.", "The court-ordered detox was brutal; Smith says the highest available dose of Methadone\u2014a synthetic opiate given to help ease the pain of withdrawal\u2014paled in comparison to the amount of smack he had been injecting every day.", "\"I think the longest opiate person they ever had stayed for seven days,\" Smith says.", "\"I was there for eleven.\"", "To get through it, he re-", "read journalist Michael Azerrad's Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, a nonfiction book originally published a year before Kurt Cobain's death.", "\"It made me feel like I was back on the road with my band,\" Smith says.", "\"It made me feel like there was a world out there.\"", "After he was discharged, he says the possibility of losing Ferreira did more to keep him straight than any recovery program.", "\"Sky was extremely adamant that I couldn't be using drugs and be in a relationship with her at the same time,\" Smith says.", "\"Given that choice, it's pretty fucking obvious which direction to go in.\"", "Smith tells me he's clean now, or heroin-free at least (on more than one occasion, we drink together).", "It's obvious he's excited about his sprawling new double-LP, animatedly introducing each track as he plays it in the van on the way to Catskill: \"This is my favorite song!\" he says.", "\"No, this one!\"", "He only sings along once, when we listen to a moody number featuring Ferreira speak-singing some abstract poetry.", "Musically, Is the Is Are is both a continuation of Oshin's songcraft and an introduction to a sharper and more labored-over DIIV sound.", "Some new tracks sound angry\u2014like \"Dust,\" a seismic standout that has been in the band's live set for almost two years.", "And some sound pensive, such as a pretty song Smith's been calling \"Healthy Moon,\" which opens with the lazily sung lyric: How can I describe this fading dream?", "It's a simple sentiment, but one that seems to precisely explain the half-cognitive euphoria DIIV's music captures, a fearless high that's always on the verge of slipping away.", "It doesn't take long to work out that a lot of the songs are about wrestling with addiction: on one, Smith sings the Alcoholic Anonymous catchphrase, It works if you work it, and another goes, I was high but now I feel low.", "On Oshin, the vocalizations were muddled in the mix, just another gear in Smith's delirium-inducing machine.", "\"This time,\" he says, \"I really wanted people to be able to understand the words and connect with them.\"", "These songs are more observational and more confessional, influenced by his personal demons and those stalking the people closest to him.", "\"There's a lot of people around me who were doing really badly, and there were a lot of people around me doing well,\" Smith says.", "\"And I knew which one I wanted to be.\"", "\"I hate this fucking place,\" Smith says, jostling the knob on the Catskill house's gray door.", "We're standing on stepping stones in the house's overgrown garden, which you get to by crossing an actual white picket fence and walking down a lumpy green hill, one street over from the town's storybook Main Street.", "When we finally get inside, the first thing that catches my eye is an artist badge from the ill-fated 2013 Basilica festival, resting on an ugly brown rug.", "Somehow, DIIV wound up performing there the day after Smith's arrest, when Basilica founder and legendary Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur bailed him out of jail.", "There isn't much stuff left to pack up, though almost everything Smith uncovers seems to have some deep-seated sentimental value.", "Looking through the crates of books, he singles out an odd tome called Shaman that he and Perez found on the street in Brooklyn years ago.", "Its pages contain some of the band's more recognizable imagery, including the ancient stone carvings Smith screen-printed onto some CD-Rs he burned for early demos of \"Sometime\" and \"Corvalis.\"", "During a break from loading the van, he gets a text saying that Saint Laurent is looking for last-minute male models to walk in the upcoming show.", "Bailey strips down to his shorts and pouts against the off-white wall while Smith snaps a few iPhone pics to send to casting.", "Some of Smith's most prized possessions are also still tucked away in the house, including two guitars.", "One is an electric that his father gave to him at birth; it's dark blue and has little cowboy-themed drawings on it, supposedly made from children's pajamas found in a ghost town.", "The second is a beat-up acoustic that used to belong to Elliott Smith, the singer-songwriter who committed suicide at the age of 34.", "Ferreira got it from composer Jon Brion\u2014a friend of Elliott's who collaborated with Ferreira on her 2012 EP, Ghost\u2014and gifted it to Smith on their first Valentine's Day together.", "When he finds it, he pulls it out of the case, strums a few clumsy chords, and starts to play \"Alameda,\" a sad song that Elliott Smith released in 1997: Nobody broke your heart/ You broke your own cause you can't finish what you start, he sings.", "Nobody broke your heart.", "Elliott Smith is just one of several doomed rock stars the DIIV frontman is obsessed with.", "He's a big fan of garage punk icon Jay Reatard, who died in his sleep from a mixture of cocaine and alcohol, and he's unabashed about his love for Johnny Thunders, the legendary New York punk guitarist whose seemingly drug-related death at age 39 remains a mystery to this day.", "And, of course, there's Kurt Cobain, whose name comes up often during our time together, though Smith just calls him \"Kurt.\"", "In the car earlier, we talked about Montage of Heck, the recently released documentary that stitches together rare home-movie footage of the Nirvana frontman with rotoscope-animated reenactments of his early life.", "Smith watched it with his mother, who he says felt uncomfortable because she had trouble separating the platinum-blond boy on screen from her own son.", "In the homemade music video Smith directed for Ferreira's 2013 song \"Omanko,\" there's a shot of the couple in their bathroom mirror.", "Smith's got the camcorder in one hand, and he leans down to give Ferreira a soft kiss on her face.", "It's a romantic image but also an eerie one, like footage waiting to be unearthed by a documentary crew a couple decades into the future.", "Smith seems to feel a kinship with this contingent of gone-too-soon songwriters.", "But at this particular moment in time, it doesn't really seem like he's looking for his own tragic ending\u2014not now, anyway.", "There's a beautiful new album on the way and too much to lose, including the unwavering support of Ferreira.", "\"I've put her through a lot,\" Smith says of his girlfriend.", "\"She dealt with all of it and continued to love me.\"", "It's hard to know if the long-delayed Is the Is Are will be a success\u2014and whether a band like DIIV can ever fully bounce back from all the blog-world controversies, addictions, and interpersonal struggles that have riddled its upward trajectory from the start.", "But though nothing is certain, Smith isn't ready to give up just yet, and it's time once again to go home to New York.", "Before we leave Catskill, Smith stops at a tiny store on Main Street.", "\"I got you a present,\" he says when he emerges, tossing me a strawberry-flavored Ring Pop, and keeping another for himself.", "Bailey carefully steers the van onto the road, dodging a few slow-moving townies ambling around on foot.", "\"All these upstate towns are totally stuck in time,\" Bailey says as we start the drive back home.", "For a couple seconds, we can see the little house's red bricks through the trees.", "Smith puts his slender hand out the open window, the spit-covered candy jewel on his finger glistening in the day's last light.", "\"Bon voyage, baby,\" he says, waving to no one.", "##### Pre", "-order a copy of DIIV's issue of The FADER now.", "It

TriStar Pictures", "Unveiling the Cannes official selection in Paris, festival president Pierre Lescure and artistic director Thierry Fremaux set the stage for an epic clash between the powers of good (including Steven Spielberg's big friendly giant, \"The BFG,\" and Shane Black's \"Nice Guys\") and evil (\"Money Monster\" and \"The Neon Demon\") among its English-language fare, which also includes new films from Jeff Nichols (\"Loving\"), Sean Penn (\"The Last Face\") and Jim Jarmusch \u2014 the latter bringing both bus-driver drama \"Paterson\" and Iggy Pop docu \"Gimme Danger.\"", "While paparazzi will have plenty of American stars to distract them on the red carpet \u2014 ranging from Shia LaBeouf (who headlines British director Andrea Arnold's \"American Honey\") to a double helping of Kristen Stewart (appearing in both \"Personal Shopper\" and the previously announced opening night film, Woody Allen's \"Cafe Society\") \u2014 the lineup also includes new work from such high-profile directors as Pedro Almodovar (\"Julieta\"), Park Chan-wook (\"The Handmaiden\") and Paul Verhoeven (\"Elle\").", "The 49 titles unveiled on Thursday represent 28 countries in all, with an especially strong showing for Romania (with two films in competition, past Palme d'Or winner Cristian Mungiu's \"Graduation\" and Cristi Puiu's \"Sierra-Nevada,\" and debut \"Dogs\" in Un Certain Regard), Israel (\"Personal Affairs,\" \"Beyond the Mountains and Hills\") and, of course, France.", "While French producers and distributors exert intense pressure on Fremaux and his team, the big winner is American newcomer Amazon Studios, with five films in official selection.", "As for the global range of the lineup, such diversity is to be expected from the world's leading showcase for international cinema, though questions from the assembled journalists immediately revealed perceived blind spots in the lineup (\"No Italy!?\" \"Where's Mexico?\").", "Fremaux shrugged off such concerns, stressing that the selection represents the best of the record-setting 1,869 features submitted for consideration.", "Regarding the complete absence of Italian filmmakers in competition (a mere year after three of the country's top directors wrestled for the Palme), Fremaux said the country's rising generation of filmmakers was repped by Stefano Mordini (\"Pericles the Black Man\") in Un Certain Regard, quipping, \"Italy is close to our heart, as this year's Cannes poster demonstrates!\"", "Still, with only two from Latin America (\"Acquarius,\" from Brazilian critic-turned-helmer Kleber Mendonca Filho, and Argentine-made \"The Long Night of Francisco Sanctis\") and two from Africa (NYU-schooled Egyptian director Mohamed Diab's \"Clash\" and Mahamat-Saleh Haroun's \"A Chad Tragedy\"), Fremaux should expect further questions in the coming weeks as to the largely Euro- and U.S.-centric lineup.", "Although there are only three female directors in competition \u2014 Arnold, Nicole Garcia (\"From the Land of the Moon\" and Maren Ade (\"Toni Erdmann\") \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the directors in the overall official selection are women.", "The Un Certain Regard section features the work of five additional female helmers \u2014 and showcases a younger crop of talent overall.", "Less crowded with \"the usual suspects\" than recent years, the competition runs the gamut of age and experience, making room for rising young talents \u2014 such as Nichols (whose \"Loving\" focuses on a mixed-race American couple arrested for miscegenation in 1958) and Canadian Xavier Dolan (\"It's Only the End of the World\") \u2014 alongside more well-established auteurs.", "It's little surprise to find previous Palme d'Or winners Ken Loach (\"I, Daniel Blake\") or Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (\"The Unknown Girl\") in competition, unless you count the fact that Loach had indicated he expected to retire after 2014's \"Jimmy's Hall.\"", "The programming committee poached just one film from this year's Sundance lineup, Matt Ross' \"Captain Fantastic,\" which stars Viggo Mortensen as an anti-establishment ex-hippie.", "Apart from \"Elle\" and Nicolas Winding Refn's \"The Neon Demon\" (which Fremaux called a \"cannibal horror movie set in the fashion world\"), the competition lineup is light on genre fare, though there are other juicy examples peppered throughout the rest of the official selection \u2014 including American director Michael O'Shea's debut \"Transfiguration\" (one of \"several vampire stories in this year's lineup,\" per Fremaux) and Na Hong-jin's gritty Korean crime thriller \"Goksung\".", "While the selection is nearly complete, Fremaux indicated that he might still add one or two titles in the coming weeks, later telling Variety that he's still waiting to see Asghar Farhadi's latest.", "That said, several much-anticipated films that cineastes hoped to discover in Cannes will definitely not be there, including Martin Scorsese's \"Silence\" and Kiyoshi Kurosawa's \"The Woman in the Silver Plate,\" neither of which is done, according to Fremaux.", "\"I have seen parts of it, but it's not ready even though it finished shooting last year,\" he said.", "Among the other conspicuous omissions was a closing night movie, which Fremaux explained by saying he instead plans to end the festival by re-screening whichever film wins the Palme d'Or.", "Asked if that change in strategy was a way to solve the eternal dilemma of finding a decent film to wrap the festival, Fremaux pointed out some closing films have been great successes in the history of Cannes, including Spielberg's \"E.T.\" and Ridley Scott's \"Thelma & Louise.\"", "But he acknowledged that the main problem with closing night is the fact that most people have already left by the end of the festival, which makes it a tough sell to convince filmmakers who want to provide the best showcase for their movies.", "By contrast, he hopes that repeating the Palme winner on closing night might bolster the slot's profile and trigger more interest in it.", "Addressing security concerns amid Europe's current terrorist turmoil, Lescure said the festival will be responsible for ensuring security inside the Palais and its immediate surroundings.", "\"We have staffed up with 599 security staff who are highly experienced,\" said Lescure, who added that the festival will be collaborating on a daily basis with local and regional authorities to provide the best possible security measures.", "Before the press conference, Lescure and Fremaux

These phthalates were detected in urine samples from 300 pregnant women.

Scott Walker made it official Monday when he gave final approval to legislation that bars unions from collecting mandatory representation fees.", "That legislation, which was hurried through the Wisconsin legislature over the past two weeks, dealt a significant blow to the state's already beleaguered labor movement.", "And it was a major victory for Walker, despite his earlier insistence that he was not interested in pushing right-to-work legislation.", "Although he never said he would oppose such a law on the merits, he repeatedly indicated that he did not want to get involved in the sort of political battle it would likely provoke.", "Now that the battle is over, the Republicans in the statehouse have passed the legislation and Walker has given it his signature, he is more than happy to claim ownership.", "Last week he for the first time said that right-to-work legislation was something \"we\" proposed in early 2015 \u2014 \"we\" meaning Walker and the Republican-controlled legislature, not just the latter.", "President Barack Obama said in a statement that he was \"deeply disappointed that a new anti-worker law in Wisconsin will weaken, rather than strengthen workers in the new economy.\"", "Then he challenged Walker: \"I'd encourage him to try and score a victory for working Americans \u2014 by taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave.", "That's how you give hardworking middle-class families a fair shot in the new economy \u2013 not by stripping their rights in the workplace.\"", "Whatever Walker's role in shepherding this particular bill to passage, he is right to claim some of the credit for making Wisconsin a right-to-work state.", "The legislation he signed into law Monday was made possible by his earlier triumphs over the state's labor movement.", "His victories offer a lesson to policymakers in other states: If you intend to hobble the labor movement as a whole, go after the public sector unions first.", "At a time of extreme weakness and vulnerability for the American labor movement, the public sector is a crucial bulwark.", "As of last year, just 6.6 percent of private employees were union members, as opposed 35.7 percent of government workers, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Because of their numbers and the fact that members are positioned in the state bureaucracy, public sector unions are relatively influential when it comes to directing government policy: Teachers' unions can use contract negotiations to exert modest influence over education policy, for example, and police unions can pressure cities to modify their approaches to crime reduction.", "Private unions may lobby the government on similar issues, but they tend to do so as outsiders.", "As a result, the typical public sector union is much harder to dislodge than the typical private sector union.", "For an ambitious governor who seeks to break what remains of the labor movement's power in a state, public unions represent a greater obstacle.", "The right-to-work legislation that Walker signed into law applies to public and private sector unions.", "But that law might not have been conceivable if Walker had not first succeeded in passing Act 10, a 2011 law that applied exclusively to government employee unions.", "That bill struck at the core function of American labor unions: collective bargaining.", "Under Act 10, most state employee unions were limited to negotiating solely over their members' salaries and virtually no other issues related to workplace conditions.", "State employee unions, with the assistance of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, fought Act 10 with nearly everything they had.", "But Walker won that fight, with disastrous consequences for public sector labor.", "Union membership among government workers collapsed, dropping from 50 percent to 37 percent in just one year.", "By 2014, the annual budget for the Wisconsin State Employees Union shrank by two-thirds from three years earlier.", "If the public sector was a fortress for the state's labor movement, then its walls had been breached.", "Four years after Act 10, Wisconsin Republicans proposed right-to-work legislation that would affect both public and private sector unions, and thousands of protesters descended on the state capital to register their disapproval.", "But this time around, the outcome of the fight was practically a foregone conclusion.", "Republicans got the bill out of committee and onto the governor's desk in short order, with little in the way of meaningful obstruction.", "Without the leverage to switch votes, local labor leaders said they were focused on educating the public about the harmful effects of right-to-work laws.", "The GOP was able to push through right-to-work legislation with relative ease because the local labor movement had already been dealt a body blow.", "As a result, Wisconsin's experience seems to have served as an object lesson for other governors who favor right-to-work policies.", "For example, Bruce Rauner, the recently elected governor of Illinois, has tried to impose right-to-work on the public sector by way of executive order.", "Clashes between state officials and public sector unions aren't necessarily a prelude to right-to-work bills.", "Even in states where such legislation is unlikely to ever be made law \u2014 including in states where the governor is a Democrat \u2014 policymakers and government employee unions are battling over issues such as pension cuts and charter school expansion.", "While legislative hardball over retirement funds might not be as much a threat to state employee unions as Act 10, it may do its part to sap whatever strength they have left.",

individuals with a light coloured mouth may also be encountered.", "When threatened, the snake is quick to draw back into a striking position, may form a narrow hood and opens the mouth to expose the interior.", "Much has been said about the length of the Black Mamba and social media is inundated with reports of monster mambas that were either killed or captured and supposedly accurately measured.", "The size of the Black Mamba is often exaggerated and stories of 6 m Black Mambas are commonplace.", "In the literature, it is said to reach a maximum length of 4.5 m but in the past 30-odd years the longest Black Mamba accurately measured was 3.8 m long.", "In some cases a piece of string was used to measure the snake, or the width of the road or even markers in the field which may then be measured later.", "Over the years there has been a great deal of research done on the Black Mamba, not just in South Africa but throughout its range.", "Specimens have been accurately measured by a number of scientists and some specimens have been deposited into museum collections where they are still available for further scrutiny.", "In Broadley's FitzSimons Snakes of Southern Africa, internationally recognised as an authoritative book on the snakes of Southern Africa, Broadley mentions that the Black Mamba may exceptionally reach 4.3 m in length 'in exceptional cases'.", "In Pitman's Snakes of Uganda he puts the maximum length at 3.048 m but also says that this snake 'may exceptionally reach 4.267 m'.", "Ionides (the Snake Man) who probably caught more snakes in Africa than anyone else that I know of, mentions a maximum length of 3.2 m in Tanzania.", "In Dangerous Snakes of Africa by Spawls and Branch they speak of unsubstantiated reports of a 4.3 m Black Mamba while Visser and Chapman, in Snakes and Snakebite (1978) say that the Black Mamba may exceptionally reach 3.6 m.", "In A Field Guide to Snakes and other Reptiles of Southern Africa, Bill Branch mentions 4.3 m as an exceptional length.", "While monster mambas of around 4.3 m or even longer may well have been seen in the past, such large individuals are no longer seen, just as the big tuskers amongst the elephant are something of the past.", "It is often difficult to get an accurate measurement of snakes in the wild, particularly when the animal is curled up or crossing roads at a fast pace.", "One theory as to how the Black Mamba got it name is that it was initially called a black-mouthed mamba which, over time, became shortened to black mamba.", "Having gone through a lot of the older literature and the works of Eugene Marais who wrote extensively (and inaccurately) about mambas, my guess is that some old dark individuals were thought to be black hence the common name.", "The Black Mamba is also said to be extremely aggressive and there are many reports of mambas chasing men on horseback.", "The aggressive part and the bit about mambas chasing people are simply not true.", "Another popular myth is the one of the mamba hanging from a tree, and then biting and killing five cows as they enter the kraal.", "While it may not be impossible for a Black Mamba to kill a cow or horse, it rarely happens.", "And to kill five cows is highly unlikely both because of the venom yield of this snake and the fact that it is just not in their nature to kill large bovines that pose no real threat to a mamba.", "Then there is the mythical Ndlondlo \u2013 a massive Black Mamba with a feather on its head that moves incredibly fast and strikes like lightning.", "It moves so fast that the feather causes a whistling sound.", "At times Ndlondlo will hide in the bush and cry like a baby \u2013 should you go into the bush to investigate you risk getting killed by this snake.", "According to the myth it is by far the most dangerous snake in the world.", "I spoke to Fortune Sibaya, reptile keeper at DumaZulu Lodge near Hluhluwe in Zululand and he has quite an interesting take on this mythical snake", ": The great King Shaka used to have a large feather in his head gear as did his warriors and Fortune believes that they were called Ndlondlo.", "They were fearless warriors as was their king and their reputation was eventually passed on to the Black Mamba.", "Another theory is that someone may have observed a mamba what was busy shedding and saw a piece of skin above the head that resembled a feather.", "Either way, Ndlondlo has never been seen.", "There is also the mythical Berg Mamba in Namibia \u2013 a secretive snake that is rarely seen but it gets so big that when it approaches a jackal-proof fence with holes big enough to put your fist through, the snake has to go over the fence otherwise it may get stuck", "Aggression & Venom", "Regarding the aggression of the Black Mamba and its deadly bite.", "Dr. Darryl Wood and some of his colleagues recently brought out a paper on snakebite in Zululand \u2013 they analysed 879 snakebites over a five year period where victims ended up in hospital.", "Only 5 bites were clearly neurotoxic and in all likelihood Black Mamba bites.", "That averages out at one bite per year \u2013 again clearly not what one would expect from an aggressive snake which is prolific in Zululand.", "That it has a very potent neurotoxic venom is not in doubt.", "The maximum venom yield of a large Black Mamba is often given as 400 mg but is probably closer to 280 mg.", "Around 15 \u2013 20 mg of venom is required for a fatal bite on a human.", "Despite the deadly reputation of this snake there is a surprising number of victims that survive its bite but in severe cases large dosages of polyvalent may be required.", "Whereas the average treatment would require 10 \u2013 15 vials one patient in Zululand needed 40 vials and recovered fully.", "Although most snakebite deaths in South Africa are as a result of Black Mamba and Cape Cobra bites, treatment is very effective and often life-saving.", "It is however critically important to get victims to a hospital and onto a ventilator (if required) or to make use of a bag valve mask if the victim is not breathing.", "Although this is snake has a reputation as being the most dangerous snake in Africa, it is actually a shy and elusive snake that will endeavour to avoid humans at all costs.", "Previous Post", "Beware of the Stiletto Snake", "Next Post", "The Small

His \"Discourses\", a series of lectures delivered at the Academy  between 1769 and 1790, are remembered for their sensitivity and perception. In one lecture he expressed the opinion that \"invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory.\" William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of Reynolds ' there is much ingenuity and originality in all his academic discourses, replete with classical knowledge of his art, acute remarks on the works of others,  and general taste and discernment'. Reynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception. Critics included William Blake who published the vitriolic \"Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses\" in 1808. J. M. W. Turner and James Northcote were fervent acolytes: Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds' side, and Northcote, who spent four years as Reynolds' pupil, wrote to his family \"I know him thoroughly, and all his faults, I am sure, and yet almost worship him.\" \n The Royal Academy of Art in London celebrated their 250th anniversary in 2018, since their opening in 1768."}}

concentrated timetable on the overlapping productions was partly due to the impending birth of Winslet's third child, which arrived in December.", "\"It was such a huge jump and I just had to throw

Her part was that of Reet, a schoolgirl who helps her classmates fight against a sinister man distributing free computers to her school. She did not earn much from the job, and at 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen.

What defines American capitalism specifically and why did it become that way?'\"", "That's a hell of subject for a play to tackle, but based on my experience catching it as a work-in-progress at the 2010 Ice Factory Festival\u2026well, while I reserve the right to change my opinion based on the final version going up at COIL, I've previously described it as one of the smartest pieces of political theater I've seen in a while.", "And I'll stand by that for now.", "Fun, engaging, intelligent, non-didactic, and touching in a surprisingly humane way (given the stated subject), it challenges the standard for political theater in America and is one of the shows I'm most excited to see this January.", "The TEAM coalesced around Chavkin back in December 2004, mainly consisting of fellow NYU alums.", "The name was originally based on Chavkin's college nickname (I did not get that story) but, following the advice of an accountant from the Field who said they'd never be able to incorporate a company named \"The Team,\" the company decided to make it an acronym.", "In fact, the first group writing assignment was to come up with what \"team\" stood for, and the combined result was the portentous \"Theater of the Emerging American Moment.\"", "Today, the company has nearly doubled in size, mainly with other NYU-trained artists but also including a couple designers with experience at the SITI Company, owing no doubt to Chavkin's further training at Columbia with Anne Bogart.", "Chavkin serves as artistic director of the company and the director of the company's shows, though, given the collaborative nature of the endeavor, she describes herself as an \"editor,\" bringing together the disparate strands developed through the generative process.", "The TEAM's Rachel Chavkin and Amber Gray, with the Edinburgh Fringe Herald Angel Award they won for \"Mission Drift.\"", "Mission Drift is the sort of play that suffers in description.", "Essentially, it tells the story of two couples.", "The first is Joris and Catalina Rapelje, a fictionalized version of the couple known proverbially as the American Adam and Eve.", "Married in the Netherlands in 1624, the couple moved the North America the same year and ultimately settled in New Amsterdam, where they're credited with giving birth to the first European child in the city; today they count some one million Americans as descendants.", "In Mission Drift, the two exist as perpetual adolescents who set out from New Amsterdam in the Seventeenth Century and follow the westward expansion until 1890, when the Census declared the \"end of the frontier,\" with all supposedly \"vacant\" land in the United States settled.", "The two find themselves left in the city of Las Vegas, where they set out to create a new frontier through capitalist enterprise.", "Joan is a native of present-day Las Vegas, consigned to working odd service sector jobs while engaging in a form of urban archaeology by preserving the ever disposed signage of the strip as a volunteer at the \"Neon Boneyard,\" an amateur museum experiment I was surprised to discover is real.", "(Sadly, apparently, others have, too; according to Chavkin, when the company visited a couple years ago it was still below the radar.", "Recently though she heard from a friend there that the city's Office of Cultural Affairs had learned of it and, unintentionally echoing a line from the play, the friend told Chavkin that they \"looked at the Neon Boneyard and saw dollar signs.\")", "Joan's erstwhile love-interest is a member of the Southern Paiute tribe displaced by development, forced out of his home by the city pursuing the water rights to his family's well.", "What ultimately unfolds is a drama of conflicting interests, with Catalina occupying the role of frontiersman, longing for the possibility of new discovery and in love with power of creation to cultivate the emptiness of the American desert.", "Her path is related to the rapacious capitalism Joris indulges, but whereas he's in love with the accumulation of wealth, she's is driven by a different need, and this conflict ultimately draws them apart.", "For Chris, the Paiute, either way, the city they've built as developers has displaced him (and whoever said the desert was empty, anyway?) and he rebels against the very existence of Las Vegas.", "Joan, a non-aboriginal native of the constructed city, finds herself displaced from her own home through the rapacious development of the Rapeljes (mirroring, of course, the real estate bubble that popped shortly after the TEAM began the project).", "Oh, and Mission Drift is also a musical.", "Of a non-traditional sort.", "With performances and music by the amazing Heather Christian as Miss Atomic.", "Got all that?", "\"I think our endless process\u2013and probably endlessly frustrating process\u2013is one of the things that gives our work the density that I hope people associate with our plays,\" Chavkin told me.", "The TEAM's work is devised through a lengthy and intense process.", "I asked Chavkin to describe the process of developing the final work, and for simplicity's sake, she limited her explanation to the character of Joan, by way of example.", "Beginning at an early workshop at the Brick Theater in 2009, four of the company members were working on different things.", "Jess Almasy was interested in developing a character who believed she was Joan of Arc, envisioning the role as a Wisconsin transplant to Vegas.", "Jill Frutkin was interested in the issue of prostitution, and discovered an organization called Hookers for Jesus, comprised of born-again former prostitutes seeking to help others leave the profession.", "Libby King was fascinated with Hunter S. Thompson.", "And Kristen Sieh was interested in playing a tumbleweed, or desert native.", "The name \"Joan\" stuck, elements of one or another enterprise went into the final character\u2013a Vegas/desert native, volunteer at the Neon Boneyard, and a theme-restaurant waitress\u2013while others went by the wayside or were incorporated into other characters (the Rapeljes became the immigrants to Vegas).", "I knew that an important part of the development had taken place in Las Vegas itself, but when I asked Chavkin who had supported their residency and work on the ground, I got an emphatic \"No one.\"", "\"We fundraised like fucking crazy and we tried for support,\" she said.", "\"And now I'm thrilled to say we just got a grant from the NEA to bring the final work back to Vegas.\"", "Ultimately the company paid out of pocket or relied on donations to spend a month in the city, and in her role as director-cum-editor, Chavkin arranged a tight schedule of \"field trips\" to experience the place in the mornings, followed by intensive work in the theater the University of Las Vegas donated for their use in the afternoons.", "In their field trips, they met with and interviewed members of the local culinary workers' union, to get a sense of the labor reality in Vegas.", "They visited the Atomic Testing Museum (the testing of the bomb also figures apocalyptically in the play).", "Another trip took them to the Springs Preserve, an institution devoted to the history of the desert ecology and sustainable development, which ultimately features prominently into the work's theme.", "\"Las Vegas\u2013which I actually didn't know before we started this piece\u2013used to be a fertile valley,\" Chavkin told me.", "\"It means 'the meadows.'", "And it was totally green, totally lush.", "It was an oasis.", "And that was due to the Springs Reserve, which was the aquifer underground that got destroyed in the Fifties, it was tapped out very, very quickly.\"", "Another exercise took them to the Luxor casino, where each member's assignment was to interview three people: an employee, an apparent non-employee, and then whoever they wanted.", "The intense engagement with the city had a profound impact on the story that the company finally presented in Mission Drift.", "\"The entire way we portray Las Vegas, I can trace it back to a couple interviews we did,\" she recalled.", "\"One was with a guy who worked at the culinary union who turned out to have been born and bred in Las Vegas.", "He was about sixty, as was the head of the office of Cultural Affairs for the city, also in her early sixties.", "Both of them born and raised in Las Vegas.", "Very unusual because Las Vegas was a town of about 300,000 for a long period of time.", "And we heard from both of them almost the exact same thing, which was, this this used to be a small western town.", "This used to be a small town.", "Vegas used to be for the locals.", "It was this phrase we just kept hearing again and again and again.", "And when we asked about the destruction that had been wrought by the mortgage crisis, every single one of them said, 'We think growth is good.", "And we don't think growth is bad, we think it's good that Vegas is growing as a city.", "We just think it grew too fast.'", "So I think the entire thesis of the play, that there is something unsustainable about the marriage of capitalism and the frontier, came from right there.\"", "The one caveat I'd really like to add to all this is that, notwithstanding the influence of thinkers like Naomi Klein on the work, the reason I have so much respect for this play is that the TEAM is so decidedly opposed to easy answers.", "No matter what you ultimately think of Klein's work, she is rather easily caricatured as a leftist taking potshots at ideological enemies.", "The TEAM are not.", "Their entire portrayal of the shape of American capitalism through the stories they tell is deeply sensitive and avoids easy answers or taking potshots.", "Intelligently, the company appears to have jointly come together in an effort to present the shape of our economy\u2013including its disastrous boom-and-bust destructiveness\u2013as a function of something deeper in the American psyche, the longing for creating things, for expanding the frontiers and filling the empty spaces our European ancestors imagined the deserts and plains and mountains of the frontier to be.", "Watching it the first time, I was struck by the thematic similarity between Mission Drift and Cormac McCarthy's remarkable novel Blood Meridian, even as they diverged radically in tone, aesthetics, and politics.", "Mission Drift is, as Chavkin also pointed out, a Western, one that links disparate elements together to pose a vexing problem\u2013perhaps the most vexing problem facing our society today.", "It was the novelist Chad Harbach, lately the lauded author of The Art of Fielding, who posed it to me years ago in a Seattle bar: \"What if growth itself is the problem?\"", "And beyond all of that is the fact that it's just a damn fine story.", "\"It is by far and away the most emotional of any of our works.", "It's, sort of\u2013separate from the politics for a minute\u2013it's just an incredibly emotional story, because we tell the story of capitalism in this country through the lens of a marriage dissolving, and a marriage that you really love,\" Chavkin said.", "\"And now I hope we've done a really good job of allowing you to fall in love with these characters and root for them, in the way you sort of root for this American thing of setting out for the territories.", "And then they just become horrible, and monsters of themselves and lost within that.\"", "Tagged with: apap

prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race in certain areas of British life, particularly housing, where many local authorities had been refusing to provide houses for immigrant families until they had lived in the country for a certain number of years.\n One feature of his speech was the extensive quotation of a letter he received detailing the experiences of one of his constituents in Wolverhampton. The writer described the fate of an elderly woman who was supposedly the last White person living in her street. She had repeatedly refused applications from non-Whites requiring rooms-to-let, which resulted in her being called a \"racialist\" outside her home and receiving \"excreta\" through her letterbox. \n When Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to tell her that he was going to sack Powell, she responded: \"I really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis\". Heath sacked Powell from his Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech and he never held another senior political post again. Powell received almost 120,000 (predominantly positive) letters and a Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 74 per cent of those asked agreed with his speech and only 15 per cent disagreed, with 11 per cent unsure. One poll concluded that between 61 and 73 per cent disagreed with Heath sacking Powell. According to George L. Bernstein, many British people felt that Powell \"was the first British politician who was actually listening to them\"."}}

In 1761 Herbert's descendant Sir John Perrot sold Woodstock to Admiral Thomas Tucker. The manor is mentioned many times in respect of indentures, grants and tenancies in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1717 Woodstock mill was leased to yeoman Lewis John. \n Richard Fenton, in 1811, recorded passing through Woodstock, stating that the name came from an extensive manor owned in early times by Huko Hywel, whose daughters married Normans, and that the manor eventually came into the possession of the Perrott family."}}

This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The Monothelite position was developed as a compromise between the dyophysitists and the miaphysists, who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from Nestorianism. The Monothelites adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the hypostatic union: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for \"one will\"), which led some to charge them with Apollinarian monophysitism. \n The Monothelite position was promulgated by Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople and by Maximus' friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis, Pyrrhus. Following the death of Sergius in 638, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed owing to political circumstances. During Pyrrhus' exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will."}}

off their new bus route.", "I was tempted to go, but I don't get up before noon unless I really have to.", "The route is the 747 Express bus, which finally provides a direct, non-stop link between downtown and Dorval Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport.", "It replaces an awkward public transit travel itinerary that involved taking the metro to Lionel-Groulx, hopping on the 211 or 221 and squeezing in with all the West Island kids, then either waiting half an hour at the Dorval train station or walking across the entire airport parking lot to get to the terminal.", "It also replaces La Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise's A\u00e9robus shuttle service between the bus station and the airport that used to run every half hour and cost $16.", "(And that was already much cheaper than the flat-rate $38 for a cab from downtown to the airport.)", "More details from Cyberpresse, The Gazette, CTV, CBC, Rue Frontenac, Metro, the STM's press release, the airport's press release (PDF), or the Planibus with route and schedule (PDF).", "The route enters service on Monday, March 29, and will be the STM's first 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year bus service.", "#### The fares", "Probably the most confusing thing about this bus will be the fare structure.", "Even though this is an STM bus run by the STM and accepting STM passes, you won't be able to pay a standard single fare or use a single-fare ticket to get on (which, because this is a trip into and out of town, is what many people using it would want to do).", "Instead, the single-fare price is set at $7 (still less than half the old airport express), and in exchange you're given a one-day pass to use the entire STM network.", "Or you could just buy a one-day tourist pass, which is accepted on the bus and also costs $7.", "All unlimited-use passes (tourist passes, weekly passes, monthly passes) are accepted on the bus at no extra charge.", "I guess the STM is trying to get some money out of tourists with this, but it just seems unnecessarily confusing.", "Many tourists will want the tourist pass anyway when they're coming in to town, so it won't make much of a difference for them.", "Those heading out of town, meanwhile, will have no use for a one-day pass once they're on a plane.", "Expect drivers of these buses to have to exercise a lot of patience explaining the fare structure.", "The STM says transit passes will be on sale in the airport, so those who want a three-day pass or weekly pass will have that option before they get on the bus.", "#### The stops", "Nine stops westbound and 10 stops eastbound, including the two terminuses.", "Going toward the airport:", "Station Centrale bus terminal (inside the terminal)", "Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque and St-Laurent (Chinatown)",

morning and evening weekday rush hours", "Every 30 minutes during midday and late evenings", "Every 30 minutes on weekends", "Every hour overnight between 1am and 5am", "Depending on the time of day and traffic conditions, the entire trip from one terminus to the other is expected to take between 35 and 50 minutes (about half that for trips between the airport and Lionel-Groulx).", "It's unclear at this point how this bus will affect other STM buses, like the 211 and 221 that shuttle between Lionel-Groulx and the Dorval train station, and the 204 bus that stops at the airport terminal.", "#### The bus", "The bus itself will be special, though very familiar to STM users.", "The outer design will have an airplane-chevron logo and the bus number painted on the body.", "Inside, the bus will be equipped with three luggage racks (one above each front wheel, and one just opposite the rear door), each with two shelves.", "This means the bus will have fewer seats than a standard bus of its size, but the ride will be more convenient for people with heavy bags.", "The STM has modified eight buses for this route.", "With a route length of just under an hour and a minimum headway of 20 minutes, that would mean six buses in service during rush hour with two spares.", "#### The fallout", "Despite its confusing fare structure, since the bus is replacing a service already in place, and because people have been demanding better airport shuttle service for years, the demand is clearly there.", "The bus might not see dozens of passengers for every trip, but it won't be empty all the time either.", "The STM estimates the bus will attract between 1,000 and 2,500 riders daily.", "With about 100 departures a day, this would mean about 10-25 people per bus on average.", "As the ADM points out, this service will also be useful for airport employees who work at odd hours.", "I've seen a few of them half asleep on the 356 night bus (which stops at the airport) trying not to get thrown up on.", "Those employees aren't going to spend $16 one-way for the A\u00e9robus, but they will take the STM's express bus if it comes with their monthly pass.", "This service also doesn't preclude the creation of a train link between downtown and the airport.", "Both the STM and the airport still believe such a rail service is essential.", "But this bus will help bridge the gap until the rail dream becomes a reality.", "#### The scandal", "One group has already called foul in all this: taxi drivers.", "They're calling this a \"catastrophe\" for the industry, and complaining that they weren't consulted about it.", "Some are suggesting that the STM's move should be considered illegal competition from a government agency with the private sector.", "Not that I don't have sympathy for taxi drivers, but this just exemplifies the fact that some industry somewhere will have a problem with just about anything the government does, especially when it makes our lives easier and saves us money.", "(UPDATE March 17: Taxi drivers took their protest to city hall, though it's highly unlikely they'll be able to get anything changed at this point)", "With that caveat in mind, I'd rate this service an about-fscking-time.", "UPDATE (March 29): The service launched at midnight.", "CTV's Herb Luft talked to some of the first passengers, and noted that the bus doesn't accept bills, which is kind of silly when the fare is $7.", "He also points out that the stop doesn't say where at the airport passes can be bought.", "### Post navigation", "\u2190 Nancy Wood saga isn't going away

When Stephen Orlac's hands are destroyed in a train accident, Yvonne brings him to Gogol, who claims to be able to repair them. As Gogol becomes obsessed to the point that he will do anything to have Yvonne, Stephen finds that his new hands have made him into an expert knife thrower. \n \"Mad Love\" was Freund's final directorial assignment and Lorre's American film debut. Critics praised Lorre's acting, but the film was unsuccessful at the box office. Film critic Pauline Kael found the film unsatisfactory, but argued that it had influenced \"Citizen Kane\". Cinematographer Gregg Toland was involved in the production of both films."}}

Canada jays do not change their feeding behavior if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not forget. A nesting female that had become accustomed to being fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the Canada jay, including \"lumberjack\", \"meat-bird\", \"venison-hawk\", \"moose-bird\", and \"gorby\", the last two popular in Maine in the northeastern United States. The origin of \"gorby\", also spelt \"gorbey\", is unclear but possibly derived from \"gorb\", which in Scottish Gaelic or Irish means \"glutton\" or \"greedy (animal)\" or in Scots or northern English \"fledgling bird\".\n Superstition in the northeast (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated about a man who plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it does not appear to have been extant in 1902. \n In January 2015, The Royal Canadian Geographical Society's magazine, \"Canadian Geographic\", announced a project to select a national bird for Canada, a designation which the country has never formally recognized."}}

She was intimidated by the scope of the production, as she featured in every scene of the 280-page script. She was disturbed and upset by the story, and was particularly fascinated by the complex relationship between the mother-daughter pair. She collaborated closely with the production and costume designers, and learnt to bake pies and prepare chickens. The broadcast received a limited audience but gained positive reviews. Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon called the series a \"quiet, heartbreaking masterpiece\" and described Winslet's performance as \"terrific\u2014intelligent, focused and seemingly devoid of ego\". She received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress, in addition to Golden Globe and SAG Award wins. \n The ensemble thriller \"Contagion\" from Steven Soderbergh was Winslet's first film release of 2011. She was cast as a disease detective for the CDC, and she modelled her role on Anne Schuchat, the director of the NCIRD."}}
